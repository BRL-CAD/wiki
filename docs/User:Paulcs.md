### LPT Interface

This is about computer control. The hardware Interface is complete. I
started the software part to develop in Objective-C. I have a plan to
connect to this Interface some mechanics designed with BRL-CAD. So far
this is only in my imagination.

### Two wheel robot with IR sensor

This is so far only in my imagination. For this robot to accomplish, I
shall use gEDA suite for electronic part, PIC programming for the brain
of robot, and BRL-CAD for the body of robot.
