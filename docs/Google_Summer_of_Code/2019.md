# Accepted Projects

## Porting SVGNest to C++

-   Implementing auto-arrange feature in Slic3r to help print as much
    objects as we can on the print bed to speed up total printing time.
    SVGNest is a JS library which implements a nesting algorithm which
    is what we need.

## Automate Reinforcement Process in FreeCAD

-   This project is to automate Reinforcement process by using Rebar
    Addon in FreeCAD. The idea is to create UI on top of the current
    implementation to combine different types of Rebars in a single
    Dialog Box as per the user requirements. For example, combine
    Stirrups and Rebars (different types of rebars) in case of Beam
    Reinforcement.

## Extending BRL-CAD's Online 3D Geometry Viewer Visualization Utility and Features

-   This project aims to enable CAD designers to quickly share and view
    designs easily on web and mobile web platforms. Through fully
    extending the UI to be responsive and enhancing the visualization
    features, users will now be able to share and customize their CAD
    designs quickly through the web through on their mobile devices.
    Enabling the sharing of CAD Designs online may be beneficial to
    sharing information with the community.

## Improvement of OpenSCAD Text-Editor Features

-   The goal of this project will be to add different IDE-like features
    to the integrated text editor thus advancing its usage. This will
    make the editor more user-friendly and easier to handle large codes.
    I will work on implementing multi-file editing support to the editor
    and autocompletion of OpenSCAD keywords.
