# Overview

Google Code-in is a program run by Google since 2010 that introduces
young pre-university students (13 to 17 years old) to open source.
BRL-CAD has participated in GCI for a number of years and it works like
this:

-   We create a bunch of tasks for students to work on BRL-CAD.
-   A student picks a task from the list and works on it.
-   The student can ask questions or get help from mentors and submits
    their work when they're done.
-   A BRL-CAD mentor reviews the work and either sends it back for more
    work or accepts it as completed successfully.

# Getting Started [Checklist](http://brlcad.org/wiki/Google_Code_In/Checklist)

Whether you're applying or accepted, we've itemized everything you need
to do into a simple
[CHECKLIST](http://brlcad.org/wiki/Google_Code_In/Checklist). We're here
to help you become new open source developers, so don't be shy if you
have any questions.

# BRL-CAD participation in GCI

## Google Code-In 2018

As before, we did not apply this year. We needed a break.

## Google Code-In 2017

And again! BRL-CAD is 1 of 25 orgs accepted into the program.

## Google Code-In 2016

We're back! BRL-CAD is 1 of 17 orgs accepted into the program.

## Google Code-In 2015

Still integrating prior tasks, we did not apply. We also needed time to
focus on a major release and were quite exhausted after GCI 2014. We
needed a break.

## [Google Code-In 2014](Google_Code_In/2014 "wikilink")

With 393 tasks completed, this was a hugely productive year. By a simple
wallclock conservative measure, those tasks constitute roughly 10
full-time years of effort.

## [Google Code-In 2013](Google_Code_In/2013 "wikilink")

## [Google Code-In 2012](Google_Code_In/2012 "wikilink")

This was the first year doing GCI. BRL-CAD was 1 of 10 organizations
selected. Student response was
[overwhelming](http://brlcad.org/wiki/Community_Publication_Portal#BRL-CAD_Accomplishments_:_GCI_2012).
We learned a lot and fell in love with the program.
