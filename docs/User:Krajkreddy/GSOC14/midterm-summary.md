At the midst of coding period for my Google Summer of Code (GSoC)
project titled "Python Geometry : Python Bindings for BRL-CAD Geometry",
I will be crossing an important checkpoint viz. Midterm Evaluation. This
is prescribed by GSoC time-line and students are expected to showcase
the completion of deliverables.

My project was aimed at wrapping brlcad primitives in python
contributing to an ongoing effort of python-brlcad. I am in line with
schedule and have completed the wrapping of various major primitives.

Among the difficulties I had, the major was to accommodate to a vast
C-repository. BRL-CAD C-repository is unique of its own kind. My mentors
with organization have been supportive and patient while solving the
problems I had during the current assignment.

During the proposal I have designed my project time-line such that the
first phase included wrapping major primitives and the second phase
after midterm evaluation included wrapping of parts of BREP primitive.

This project have been a good learning experience. I have managed to
learn different aspects of software engineering effectively including
simple things like VCS, how two different languages talk, working with
different memory management techniques and also most importantly working
with a very old but still maintained core c-repository.
