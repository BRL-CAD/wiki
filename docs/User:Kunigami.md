# Experience

I've been programming in C/C++ for more than 4 years. I also like to use
Python once in a while. I know the basics of Java and PHP. I'm also
learning Haskell. Most of my programming experiences are under Linux
systems.

I've experience in analysis and design of algorithms, I've participated
on ACM-ICPC from 2005 to 2010 and sporadically play some SRM's on
Topcoder.

I was a developer student in Google Summer of Code 2011 for 4 months. On
past years I've contributed to Scilab, performing localization to
portuguese and fixing two bugs.
