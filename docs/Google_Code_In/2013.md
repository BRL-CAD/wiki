# Overview

Google Code-in is a contest run by Google with a goal of encouraging
young (13 to 17 years old) students to participate in open source. Since
2010, Google Code-in has been introducing pre-university students from
around the globe to various open source communities.

# Instructions

-   Go to our [Google Code-in](Deuces "wikilink") wiki page, read
    carefully the [CHECKLIST](Google_Code_In/Checklist "wikilink") that
    you need to follow before working for BRL-CAD
-   BRL-CAD will create a list of tasks for students to work upon. Each
    task will have a mentor associated with it.
    -   You can take a look at our [tasks here.](Deuces "wikilink")
-   A student picks a task from the list and he/she is assigned a
    deadline.
    -   While a task is claimed no other student can work on that task.
-   After completion of task it's ready to be reviewed by mentor.
-   Based on the performance of the student mentor may approve,
    disapprove or extend the deadline for the task.

BRL-CAD was one of the 10 selected communities in the year 2012. We were
again selected for 2013.
