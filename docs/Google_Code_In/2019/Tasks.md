Hi GCI Mentors!

Here's a scratch space for discussing any task or task chain ideas prior
to putting them up into the GCI system. We need every mentor to define
at least 10 detailed tasks EACH, so please do your part! Please, of
course, define more if you can.

As a reminder, non-chain tasks should:

1.  take an experienced core developer 1-2 hours
2.  not require more than the download we have in our beginner task
3.  use plain easy-to-understand titles and language
4.  be for code, web work, 3d modeling, and writing (in roughly that
    priority)

Task chains are for more complex tasks or "mini-projects". They should:

1.  be completable in less than 10 tasks (est 10-20 hours for a core
    dev)
2.  be used where there's a new download or compile step (e.g.,
    LibreCAD, FreeCAD)
3.  use this format at the end of the title: (task 1 of 4)

Here's the brainstorming we did last time:
