# Dashboard for Ideas for the Google Code In 2017

## Roles

-   Coder (C/C++)
-   Web Coder (Javascript/HTML)
-   Modeler
-   Writer

## Beginner tasks

These require absolutely no prior experience or knowledge.

These would take us more than 2 hours, to be broken up into multiple
tasks.

-   Qt/C++: New visualization GUI
-   Qt/C++: geometry viewer
    -   [BRL-CAD Viewer](https://github.com/asadpiz/brlcad-viewer):
        (Task 1) Open a simple GLFW window from the source
    -   [BRL-CAD Viewer](https://github.com/asadpiz/brlcad-viewer):
        (Task 2) Write a program that opens geometry, executes
        db_walk_tree(), and gets a bounding box.
    -   [BRL-CAD Viewer](https://github.com/asadpiz/brlcad-viewer):
        (Task 3) Print out the bounding box center point into the GUI
    -   [BRL-CAD Viewer](https://github.com/asadpiz/brlcad-viewer):
        (Task 4) Display wireframes, regions on to the window.
-   Qt/C++: openscad-style asc-to-display GUI
    -   (Task 1) Open a simple Qt window from source
    -   (Task 2) Write a program that opens .asc, displays in Qt text
        window
    -   (Task 3) Write a simple program that converts .asc to .g in
        memory
    -   (Task 4) Write a simple program that renders an in-memory .g to
        .pix
    -   (Task 5) Write a program that displays a .pix image into a Qt
        window
    -   (Task 6) Tie it all together: Qt button that converts, renders,
        and displays.
