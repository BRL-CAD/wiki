We will move on to enable the user to upload other 3D files as well. But
first we need to ensure that there are no issues in the \*.g files
whatsoever.
Some \*.g files are not being uploaded. Need to check on that.
**TODO**: Add color attributes to object file (1 week)

Just so that the user can send the developer feedback and report bugs
directly while using the web-app.
(2-3 days)

Try to join uploaded and shared model with tags for searching purposes.
