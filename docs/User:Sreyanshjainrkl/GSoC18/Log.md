### Development Logs

#### Community Bonding Period

-   During the community bonding period, I downloaded BRL-CAD and
    configured and compiled my build. Initially it had some problems
    (probably due to my proxy settings), but finally it worked while
    using Ubuntu 17.04, revision r70379 (last known working version of
    BRL-CAD with openCL) and AMD APP SDK 2.9.1 as an OpenCL ICD.

<!-- -->

-   I started to write some code in order to get an advance on my
    project. This consisted of developing HYP and ARBN shot routines in
    OpenCL as per my project plan.
