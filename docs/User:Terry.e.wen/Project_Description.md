Project Background/Summary

</h2>

Monitoring network traffic has always been an important issue of
managing and protecting data as it is passed around electronically, but
there is a lack of defining visualization possibilities which could
greatly help monitor general activity. Services such as WireShark aid in
capturing network activity but don't provide convenient illustration of
said activity.

The goal of the project is to construct an interactive visual simulation
of network activity based on imported data using Dshell or similar
framework. The simulation will be a real-time playback of all network
activity which can be adjusted based on aspects such as time frame and
playback speed. Nodes and connections are also interactive and can be
highlighted or adjusted by the user for customization and clarity.

This visualization will be constructed using the Processing language and
will be exported as a web application or an external application.

<h2>

Research

</h2>

Research that will need to be done includes a development of my own
understanding of network traffic and activity as well as what
information is to be tracked when developing this visualization. Outside
of background knowledge of networking, a design of clarity and
preferable simplicity will need to be designed to ensure the project
produces a most desirable application.

<h2>

Objectives

</h2>

-   Produce a visualization application which can be used to view and
    analyze network activity, potentially real-time.
-   Visualization will be interactive, having aspects which can be
    adjusted and customized to fit the purpose of each individual
    analysis.
-   Visualization will be informative, as the convenience and visual
    appeal of the simulation should not restrain the information the
    data is meant to present.
-   Visualization should have clarity in its presentation and be easily
    readable for analytical purposes.
