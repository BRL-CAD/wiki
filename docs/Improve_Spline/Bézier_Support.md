# Improve Spline/Bézier Support

*' LibreCAD has basic support for
[B-spline](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B-spline) and quadratic splines,
but many interesting features are still missing. For example, methods
for trimming, offsetting, hatching, tangential directions,*etc.'' are
required to allow extensive usage of splines in LibreCAD. A rather
comprehensive collection of spline mathematics can be found at [A Primer
on Bézier Curves](http://pomax.github.io/bezierinfo/) Examples of spline
features to implement:

-   Trimming
-   Hatching
-   Arc length
-   Area enclosed within a contour

## Requirement

-   C++, math

## Reference
