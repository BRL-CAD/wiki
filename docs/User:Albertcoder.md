# Projects

Included below are projects that I'm either actively working on or am
trying to actively work on.

## Materials Database (GSoC 2014 Project)

BRL-CAD uses simple material properties, presently limited to density,
for calculating weights, moments of inertia and other geometric
analyses. There is presently no centralized repository for specifying
material properties, so users have to recreate and manually share
inputs.

This website / MediaWiki extension would provide a comprehensive means
for specifying, storing, importing, export, and reusing material
properties. A few minor issues are yet to be solved which I am trying to
resolve soon.
