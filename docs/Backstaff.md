Welcome to the BRL-CAD Backstaff! Some will consider this to be a
development [roadmap](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology_roadmap)
for BRL-CAD, but it's more of a development
[backstaff](https://www.ion.org/museum/item_view.cfm?cid=2&scid=14&iid=31)
because:

1.  it's only useful half of the time,
2.  there are a lot of assumptions,
3.  the [planning
    horizon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planning_horizon) isn't very
    detailed

With most open source software development, you can only reflect on what
you've done or intend to do. Everything is tentative. Things get
implemented when a contributor has time and motivation.

Our focus is on being flexible, adaptive, and responsive. This
development "plan" is more of a common staging area so that we may hold
a common vision for **what** we're working towards even if we can't pin
down ***when*** we'll get there.
