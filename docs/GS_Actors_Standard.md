# Notes on Actors

-   An actor is a role, rather than a particular user.
-   An actor may be *external systems* the system interacts with.
-   For each actor, identify the set of goals they have when using the
    system. This will define the inital [Use
    Cases](GS_Use-Cases_Standard "wikilink").




# Example Actors

-   Actors for the GS Network Library:
    -   Network
    -   GS Executable that uses GSNetLib
