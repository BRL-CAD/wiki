make: \*\*\* No rule to make target 'uninstall'. Stop. I'd like to know
how to uninstall this mess from my computer

To uninstall, you can typically just delete BRL-CAD's installation
folder. By default, this is /usr/brlcad or another location you
specified. If you did not run "make install", then no action is
necessary, and you can simply delete your source and build directories.
