## June 22th

-   Researching Meteor and working on the 404 Fix issue over the weekend

-https://github.com/BRL-CAD/OGV-meteor/pull/89

## June 23th

-   Researching Iron-Router to be able to fix the pull request over the
    weekend

-https://github.com/BRL-CAD/OGV-meteor/pull/89

## June 24th

-   Submitted 3 Commits on the PR to recreate the 404 page properly and
    display it in the right place fixing most of the problem, now the
    link in the text to go back to the landing page doesnt work half of
    the time, trying other options

<!-- -->

-   I added the 404 page template to the error.html because error.html,
    error.js, and error.css control the 404 pages right now, and not all
    errors. Errors right now are actually controlled by alert
    notifications which I have to fix as well soon, because some of them
    come up at the wrong time, or are too intrusive.

<!-- -->

-   When researching further into app.js and the relation 404.html has
    to it, the error.js is set as the default redirect and not 404.html.
    I believe the error.js implementation is actually set up as the 404
    page due to how the set it up in Meteor in app.js

<!-- -->

-   To quickly solve this, I added the 404.html to the error.js,
    error.html to not break the routing with iron-router and fixed some
    style to center the content.

-https://github.com/BRL-CAD/OGV-meteor/pull/89/commits

## June 25th

-   Through looking into the parent-child div relationship I was able to
    find out that the SVG clouds zindex inside the parent div was
    preventing the href link from working on the text, I went ahead and
    reorganized the layout for the 404 through centering it and properly
    creating a new transparent div for the text so it is interactive.
    This link for the 404 now works 100%

\- <https://github.com/BRL-CAD/OGV-meteor/pull/89/commits>

## June 26th

-   Preparing the BRL-CAD OGV library for public hosting to more easily
    show my mentors
-   Creating another internal branch specifically for hosting as a
    Droplet in digital ocean or a hosted site on firebase (looking
    primarily into firebase)

## June 27th

-   Realized model loading and and 404 are linked to the same routing,
    discussing about separating the routing so model loading errors and
    404 page are separated the right way.

<!-- -->

-   Hosting site on firebase, getting ready to share it publicly with
    BRL-CAD

## June 28th

-   @Sean and some others wanted to see the site public, so I tried to
    look into an AWS and Digital ocean solution, but when I set up the
    dependencies and tried to deploy, they wanted to charge me, I tried
    looking for other solutions during the weekend

## June 29th

-   Looking into another solution for Meteor deployment (ZEIT)
-   Setting up ZEIT dependency to try to deploy

## July 1st

-   ZEIT deployment not working because newer v2 version of ZEIT stopped
    working with Meteor.js + MongoDB deployments
-   Had discussion with mentors about deployment, refocusing on backend
    issues and as mentors advised leave more of the frontend and
    deployment to mentors

<!-- -->

-   Refocusing on
    <https://github.com/BRL-CAD/OGV-meteor/projects/1#column-2250873>
    backend issues highly suggested and reccomended by my mentors @Panda
    @Inder

## July 2nd

-   Opened pull request for
    <https://github.com/BRL-CAD/OGV-meteor/pull/91>
-   Realized that Meteor.Settings was able to be set external, so I am
    focusing a solution around that

## July 3rd

-   Working on a better solution for
    <https://github.com/BRL-CAD/OGV-meteor/pull/91/files> which involves
    not settings the Meteor.Settings again directly, pulling the
    previous meteor settings into the solution and organizing the code
    solution more

## July 4th

-   National Holiday, submitted some more changes for
    <https://github.com/BRL-CAD/OGV-meteor/pull/91/files> but am
    reviewing <https://github.com/BRL-CAD/OGV-meteor/pull/91/commits>
    more to see how the solution can be more effiecient

## July 5th

-   Told by mentor that I should use admin@example.com to test the admin
    account, this was not directly mentioned in the issue, but I should
    have tested that with the randomized admin password. Looking more
    into testing the admin example account with the randomized password,
    but me and mentor are getting "incorrect login" errors so we are
    refactoring the solution and issue to count for that

## July 6th

-   Working on solution for issue involving Meteor.Settings being
    properly set, looking into other Meteor Account functions to use on
    the admin account

## July 7th

-   Found a function to set the password, but trying to understand more
    about why the initial way was not working with testing and logs to
    see when it pulls up incorrect password

## July 8th

-   Stuck on why it's not taking the correct password still, doing some
    more testing and understanding
    <https://github.com/BRL-CAD/OGV-meteor/issues/53> with my mentors

## July 9th

-   Taking a break on issue to look at other PR, I'm currently working
    on <https://github.com/BRL-CAD/OGV-meteor/pull/89> to find out more
    where the routing is connected too in iron-router

## July 10th

-   I have fixed <https://github.com/BRL-CAD/OGV-meteor/issues/53>
    finally!

<https://github.com/BRL-CAD/OGV-meteor/pull/91/files#diff-85207ec3ffd02327adfb13aec22778a2>

Config.json (really settings.json) described in the issue description
doesn't really have much to do with the core issue, The main issue
consisted of finding a way to get the user Id without knowing the userId
at all, finding the admin account and getting the function for setting
the password to work to allow the admin to see the randomly generated
password each time in dev console to sign in.

What was taking me so long and frustrating me was that it kept telling
me incorrect password for the sign in after setting the password
multiple ways, but it actually had an extra space at the beggining for
the admin password which was confusing me so I fixed that and now
everything works

Getting the userId for the admin to set the password or any user when
you don't have the userId saved is a bit hard. I had to get the userID
from creating logs at a specific place in explore.js when exploring
models in the client.

## July 11

-   Panda wanted me to find the user ID in a different way in the code
    review and refactor the code so it works with "meteor reset" command
    when the server resets for the admin and test user

## August 12th

-   Learning from code reviews from the previous commit. Looking into
    removing the unwanted files from the email server commit. This PR
    should only contain validator.js, signup.js, and login.js, but it
    has files from the PR before it got renamed which I must look into
    removing. This may not be possible without deleting and readding the
    files from the branches, closing the PR and creating a new one, or
    matching the commits on the files to be the same as the other PR so
    it does not conflict

## August 13th

-   Going through trial and error with the command line interface for
    git and github. Having issues with redacting a file on github with
    git CLI, researching into merging local and remote branches with git
    CLI instead. May install a plugin for VSCODE with a different github
    CLI to more easily complete this operation.

## August 14th

-   Going through trial and error learning and using the VSCODE command
    line interface for github to merge the branches on the PR's, is
    giving errors and warnings about the changes deleting the previous
    commits. Trying to solve both PR's without deleting any files. May
    have to just match the files in both PR's to avoid conflict if
    merging the branches locally and remotely does not work.

## August 15th

-   Before matching the branches, working on implementing a more final
    solution per the new review given on
    <https://github.com/BRL-CAD/OGV-meteor/pull/91>. Looking into making
    sure this solution works every time the meteor server runs.

## August 16th

-   Implemented the solution after testing, now making sure the branches
    from patch-1 and development match before commiting to both Pull
    Requests to avoid conflicts

## August 17th

-   Resetting Git Locally on computer after dealing with local file path
    errors when trying to commit. Uninstalling the VSCODE plugin CLI for
