<ol>
<li>Played around with code and build GUI.</li>
<li>Found where is auto-arrange is being called and how it's called so
    that I could get a grasp of how it should be replaced.
    <a href="https://github.com/supermerill">Supermill</a> helped by giving me
    another use of auto-arrange.</li>
<li>Looked for a faster way to build the project rather than waiting for
    15 minutes when changing anything, LoH helped me with a faster way
    to build it.</li>
<li>Investigated SVGNest JS code to get a feel of how the code is
    structured.</li>
<li>Started investigating in the SVGNest desktop application as
    <a href="https://github.com/gege2b">gege2b</a> has pointed out there is an
    implementation in C for SVGNest. After investigating I found the
    implementation isn't fully in C only one function of it is C and the
    rest is the previous JS code.</li>
<li>Today I'll start reading one of the papers.</li>
<li>I've started reading <a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.440.379&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf">"Complete and robust no-fit polygon generation
    for the irregular stock cutting
    problem"</a>
    paper and it was very helpful. I went through the rabbit hole as the
    paper references other papers so I dived head first into reading
    them. I got a better understanding of the No-Fit Polygon and what
    role does it play in the whole auto-arrange algorithm, why it's
    useful and why it's better than it's predecessors.</li>
<li>Tomorrow I'll take a look at SVGNest and compare how they implement
    the NFP with what the paper suggests. Today I'm studying for my
    final exams in my University tomorrow.</li>
<li>Finished Reading the required papers and took notes to start
    summarizing them.</li>

<li>Delivering summary on the related papers. (O)</li>
<li>Investigating SVGNest JS library (structure, utilities).</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="activity-log-for-this-period">Activity Log For This Period</h3>
<p>From 27/5 to 2/6 is my final exams week so my productivity won't be much
and I'm making up for this time in the weekends and by working extra
hours after 2/6. Deliverables won't be affected as I'm following the
timeline for each period.</p>
<ol>
<li>Investigated SVGNest C and JS code to find out what has changed
    between these two projects and if I can make use of the C
    implementation.</li>
<li>Took notes on the related papers and started summarizing them.</li>
<li>Designing bounding object function to get a 2d boundaries for the
    objects to work with.</li>
<li>Finished my final exams and working full time.</li>
<li>Faced some issues with wxWidgets library and trying to fix them.</li>
<li>Continued working on designing an efficient bounding object function
    to get 2D outer contours of 3D objects to work on them. I've looked
    for similar function in the current 2D preview functionality in the
    application but the method I want isn't there so I'll continue
    coding it.</li>
<li>Tried concave hull and found papers on generating a bounding concave
    object to generate a 2D equivalent for the objects but I found that
    there are some cases that concave hull will fail in so we'll need
    convex hull.</li>
<li>Created a class "BoundingHull" to hold the bounding shape to
    transform 3D into 2D and still maintain the boundaries of the object
    so that no two objects would intercept with each other.</li>
<li>Eid Elfetr Holiday so I'm working between family visits.</li>
<li>Completed <a href="https://github.com/3bhady/Slic3r/commit/ce678e817fb82642c68da1bd545a3bbddcee8325">calculating bounding
    hull</a>
    for each model with each copy of it after applying transformations
    on it.</li>
<li>Going through SVGNest code to find important functions to start
    writing tests for them.</li>
<li>Debugging SVGNest JS code and commenting on it while comparing the
    code to the papers.</li>
<li>Added comments and played with functions in SVGNest JS library and
    compared it to the read papers. Summary of the papers would make
    more sense being written into the code to help later in porting each
    function which relates to how each function contributes to the whole
    algorithm.</li>
<li>Forked the SVGNest repo and commenting on it

<p>NFP (No Fit Polygon) is the core of the polygon packing algorithm
    but it makes more sense to start with implementing it now and port
    helper functions along the way to understand the functions being

</li>
<li>Wrote a skeleton code for a function to calculate the maximum
