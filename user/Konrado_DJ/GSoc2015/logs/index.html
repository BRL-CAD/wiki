<h2 id="community-bonding-period">Community Bonding Period</h2>
<p>I have began this period by going through and adhering to the BRL-CAD
<a href="../../../../Summer_of_Code/Checklist/">Summer of Code/Checklist</a></p>
<p>- Working on replacing the FreeWRL dependency on automake to cmake and
generate a shared library from src/lib of the FreeWRL source code.</p>
<h2 id="coding-period">Coding Period</h2>
<h3 id="25-may-2015">25 MAY 2015</h3>
<p>- Resolving linking issues with shared library generated from src/lib
of the FreeWRL source code.</p>
<p>- Resolving FreeWRL X3D parser dependence on libxml(may need to set
compilation as optional in order not to break the BRLCAD build process)</p>
<h3 id="26-may-2015">26 MAY 2015</h3>
<p>- Trying to finalize work on shared library generation from src/lib of
the FreeWRL source code.</p>
<p>- Still working on resolving issues with shared library</p>

<p>- Testing functionality of the shared library</p>
<p>- I was not able to do much work today due to lack of electricity
through out the day</p>
<p>Time put in 3 hours</p>
<h3 id="29-may-2015">29 MAY 2015</h3>
<p>- Doing more research on the FreeWRL thread implementation to resolve
issues</p>

parse input file)</p>
<p>- As a GDGBuea organiser, I spend most of the day hosting the Google
I/O with other organisers for the GDGBuea community</p>
<p>- I would makeup for lost time today and yesterday by putting in more
hours the following days</p>
<p>Time put in 3 hours</p>
<h3 id="30-may-2015">30 MAY 2015</h3>
<p>- Made progress with debugging and just realised that issues (SIGSEGV)
are as a result of improper casting with structures and thus poor memory
allocation.</p>
<p>- I spent alot of time today working on the issues but have not yet
full resolved it.</p>
<p>Time put in 6 hours</p>
<h3 id="31-may-2015">31 MAY 2015</h3>
<p>- Resolved issues(SIGSEGV) which were as a result of improper memory
access.</p>
<p>- Futher exploited FreeWRL source code to learn more on how to
implement the parser</p>
<h3 id="1-june-2015">1 JUNE 2015</h3>

<h3 id="8-june-2015">8 JUNE 2015</h3>
<p>- Working on load function</p>
<h3 id="9-june-2015">9 JUNE 2015</h3>

<h3 id="10-june-2015">10 JUNE 2015</h3>
<p>- Finalized work on init_res() function in FreeWRL to intitialize all
required resources</p>
<p>- Did more work on main() function for the x3d parser(basic input and
outfile handling)</p>
<h3 id="11-june-2015">11 JUNE 2015</h3>
<p>- Started working on parse_scene() used to traverse the node of the
scene-graph and retrieve properties</p>
<h3 id="12-june-2015">12 JUNE 2015</h3>
<p>- I did not do any coding today as I have been trying to figure out an
efficient way to implement the conversion routines and also extract the
nodes and their properties from the root node</p>
<h3 id="13-june-2015">13 JUNE 2015</h3>
<p>- Read the HACKING BRL-CAD again paying attention to note on global
variables</p>
<p>- Continued work on parse_scene() taking into consideration what I
learn from reading the HACKING guide.</p>
<h3 id="14-june-2015">14 JUNE 2015</h3>
<p>- Started work on the do_color() function which is called by
parse_scene() to assign color values to shape nodes</p>
<h3 id="15-june-2015">15 JUNE 2015</h3>
<p>- Working on convert() function in FREEWRLwrapper</p>
<h3 id="16-june-2015">16 JUNE 2015</h3>
<p>- Futher work on convert() function in FREEWRLwrapper</p>
<h3 id="17-june-2015">17 JUNE 2015</h3>

are handled properly</p>
<h3 id="18-june-2015">18 JUNE 2015</h3>
<p>- I did not do any work today as I had lots test to do at school,
giving the teachers are rush to give us our first assesment before the
exams start next week.</p>
<p>- I would make up for this time After my exams</p>
<h3 id="19-june-2015">19 JUNE 2015</h3>
<p>No work done 0 on 5 hours put in.</p>
<h3 id="20-june-2015">20 JUNE 2015</h3>
<p>- So far I have not been able to work on my project due to some school
work. This means I have lost about 20 hours from the 18-20(today) of
June, given that I had to put in about 10 on saturday as stated on my
proposal.</p>
<p>- I would make up for this by working for about 15hours tomorrow and
then the rest would be covered after my exams.</p>
<h3 id="21-june-2015">21 JUNE 2015</h3>
<p>- Futher work on convert() function in FREEWRLwrapper (implementing
do_transforn() function as helper function to convert())</p>
<h3 id="22-june-2015">22 JUNE 2015</h3>
<p>- Spent more than six hour trying to relsolve issues with x3d ROUTE and
Script node which depened on javascript for scene-graph animations.</p>
<p>- Since this nodes would not be imported into BRL-CAD they would be no
need to parser them and their javascript dependency which would need to
be handled with care given the way FreeWRL parses input.</p>
<h3 id="23-june-2015">23 JUNE 2015</h3>
<p>- Further work on node transformation (implementing
transform_points())</p>
<h3 id="24-june-2015">24 JUNE 2015</h3>

tomorrow so would just try to clean up the work I have done to far in
preparation for mid-term evaluation.</p>
<h3 id="25-june-2015">25 JUNE 2015</h3>

<h3 id="29-june-2015-to-5-july-2015">29 JUNE 2015 to 5 JULY 2015</h3>
<p>- I was unable to do any work because of my exams</p>
<p>- Given the fact that I made the effort to put in more than 45hours a
week before this period I would have made up for some of this lost time
and I would also put in more time after my exams to meet up with my
project.</p>
