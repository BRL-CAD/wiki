<ul>
<li>Finished working on rb_delete.c .</li>

</ul>
<p>June 19</p>
<ul>

    using the blobby method , read volume rendering by Drebin et al and
    edit magic.h and rtgeom.h to include the heart primitive .</li>

<p>June 24</p>
<ul>
<li>Re-read the Patch submission guidelines in the HACKING file .</li>
</ul>
<!-- -->

<ul>
<li>Read the research paper titled "Volumetric shape description using
    the blobby model" which was used to implement the metaball primitive
    ( by the second method). Since the above method is used with two
    sphere primitives to create a metaball , I am considering using this
    same method alongside two spheres ( for the heart lobes ) and an
    elliptical parabola - epa (for the lower portion of the heart ).
    Need to verify the correctness of this design approach on the
    mailing list.</li>
</ul>
<p>June 25</p>
<ul>
<li>Studying the ray tracing geometry header ( rtgeom.h ) to write the
    heart primitive's internal representation (struct rt_hrt_internal)
    .</li>
</ul>
<!-- -->

<ul>
<li>Searching for more information on the key properties of the heart .</li>

<li>Editing the magic numbers header ( magic.h ) which I have patched
    <a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/brlcad/patches/203/">here</a> .</li>

<ul>
<li>Currently writing the struct rt_hrt_internal structure which I
    have kept <a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/brlcad/patches/204/">here</a>
    .Also wrote the RT_HRT_CK_MAGIC(_p) macro in rtgeom.h for the
    heart .</li>
</ul>
<p>June 26</p>
<ul>
<li>Finished Modifying the magic header file
    <a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/brlcad/patches/203/">here</a> which I
    earlier on submitted .</li>
</ul>
<!-- -->

<ul>
<li>Looking into the internal representations of the tor and the
    superell .</li>
</ul>
<!-- -->

<ul>
<li>Reading the rt_???_shot() functions in
    src/librt/primitives/tor/tor.c and
    src/librt/primitives/superell/superell.c to understand how they
    build up and evaluate formulae.</li>
</ul>
<!-- -->

<ul>
<li>Included the internal representation of the heart in the
    include/rtgeom.h file used by the ray trace geometry library .That
    is, added the ID_HRT section ( struct rt_hrt_internal ). Please,
    take a <a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/brlcad/patches/204/">look</a> :)</li>
</ul>
<!-- -->

<ul>
<li>Editing the table.c file in src/librt/primitives .Declared a
    raytrace interface for the heart by RT_DECLARE_INTERFACE(hrt) .
    Edited the rt_functab[] array by providing an entry ID_HRT for
    the heart primitive. That is, add RT_FUNCTAB_MAGIC, "ID_HRT",
    "hrt",rt_hrt_*, just to name a few. You are welcome to look at my
    <a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/brlcad/patches/205/">progress</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>June 27</p>
<ul>
<li>Early in the morning I Left Buea, my home town to collect Google's
    welcome package in Douala. Collected some cash from the available
    ATM . Negotiating for Internet access and cool coding
    environment.Really tired.</li>
</ul>
<p>June 28</p>
<ul>
<li>Corrected and submitted the db5 header <a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/brlcad/patches/191/">( See db5.patch

    coding.</li>
</ul>
<p>June 5</p>
<ul>
<li>Did detailed mind maps to aid visualization of necessary editing of
    files to aid submission of logical patches. This will help see
    exactly how to group file changes like magic numbers , mirror
    support, mged support, etc.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Got equipment ready for installations of Internet but could not

<h1 id="pre-midterm-evaluation-summary">Pre-midterm evaluation summary</h1>
<p>In order to prepare the BRL-CAD source code for the heart primitive , I
hooked the heart primitive into the BRL-CAD source by adding a magic
number for the heart in include/magic.h and src/libbu/magic.c, stubbing
an empty heart in include/db5.h, include/rtgeom.h, include/raytrace.h,
src/librt/db5_types.c and /src/librt/primitives/table.c and adding
typing support for the heart in the mged interface in include/wdb.h,
src/libwdb/wdb.c and src/libged/typein.c as can be seen
<a href="https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B4kEIUMOBbU-ZUpmcXpxZlFzVXc/edit?usp=sharing">here</a>.
As regards the ray tracing callback functions in
src/librt/primitives/hrt/hrt.c , I have built the hrt_specific
structure, written the rt_hrt_shot() and rt_hrt_prep() functions and
I am currently testing these.I intend to continue working on other
callback functions like rt_hrt_import(), rt_hrt_print(), etc and
finally hook the heart primitive to the mged and archer interfaces with
associated clean up and documentation.</p>

<h1 id="gsoc-2013-summary">GSoC 2013 summary</h1>
<p>For the past quarter, I've been implementing a heart primitive for the
BRL-CAD package. This project focused on writing and testing callback
functions in the ray tracing library for the aforementioned
primitive.You are invited to read my diary on
<a href="http://brlcad.org/wiki/user/Izak/GSOC_2013_logs">http://brlcad.org/wiki/user/Izak/GSOC_2013_logs</a>.</p>
<p>Despite the challenges I encountered such as the lack of Internet
connectivity for over 5 weeks before the mid-term evaluation period, I
hooked the heart primitive into the BRL-CAD source by adding a magic
number for the heart in include/magic.h and src/libbu/magic.c, stubbing
an empty heart in include/db5.h, include/rtgeom.h,
include/raytrace.h,src/librt/db5_types.c,src/librt/primitives/table.c
and src/librt/primitives/hrt/hrt.c as well as adding typing support for
the heart in the mged interface in include/wdb.h,src/libwdb/wdb.c and
src/libged/typein.c.</p>
<p>After the mid-term evaluations,I implemented ray tracing callback
functions for serialization (rt_hrt_??port), textual description
(rt_hrt_describe, rt_hrt_print) and ray tracing (rt_hrt_prep,
rt_hrt_shot and rt_hrt_norm).I also wrote a test to ensure that
BRL-CAD's root solver is stable for sextic equations and after
consulting some mathematicians, I learned that the heart's sextic
equation cannot be solved in radicals -- A pointer to which method does
not work :). Feel free to download a heart animation from
<a href="http://brlcad.org/~Izak/HeartImages/Heart.mpg">http://brlcad.org/~Izak/HeartImages/Heart.mpg</a>. You can also look at
images of the heart from 360 different angles using
<a href="http://brlcad.org/~Izak/HeartImages/">http://brlcad.org/~Izak/HeartImages/</a></p>
<p>As GSoC 2013 comes to an end, my passion to continuously contribute to
the open source community grows. I intend to finish the callbacks
functions for the heart primitive and hook the heart to the mged and
archer interfaces so the heart gets into the next BRL-CAD release :)</p>
<p>Feeling Great! :)</p></div>
