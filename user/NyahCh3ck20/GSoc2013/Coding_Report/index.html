<h4 id="coding-log-report-for-gsoc-2013">Coding Log Report for GSoc 2013</h4>
<p>Daily log:</p>
<h3 id="project-summary">PROJECT SUMMARY</h3>
<p>This year's GSoC was my first and most exciting projects given the fact
that I'm working on my first opensource project and contributing for my
first time to a great software and organization like BRL-CAD.</p>
<p>For the past three months I worked on implementing a pull routine
which reversed the effects of a push on a CSG tree. This project
focused on reversing the effects of the push command available in
BRL-CAD and also pulling up and unpushed node. While following my
implementation outline as described in my <a href="../Design_Document/">Design
Document</a>, I kept modifying the plan as needed and
tried updating my <a href="./">logs</a> daily especially when I
initially had no stable Internet access.</p>
<p>Before the Mid-term Evaluations, I studied the push and xpush routines
seeing how the matrices were pushed down the tree in respective commands
and started implementing and finished implementing the pull_comb()
routine which pulls the matrix transformations in a combination node.
Submitted patches on sourceforge for review. I tested various parts of
the routine and made sure routine works perfectly will continue testing
and fixing bugs if any post GSoC to make sure command is complete. Also,
I wrote tests for the poly.c routines and submitted patches on
sourceforge; tested the bn_mat_inverse() routine implemented for
BRL-CAD and proposed new routine which are still awaiting review by
mentors.</p>
<p>Post Mid-term evaluations, I studied the various primitives trying to
figure out how to implement the pull_leaf() routine for each primitive
which was later disproved by Sean as a bad design choice which led to my
implementing of the pull_leaf() using the AABB's of primitives which
enabled me to pull translation components successfully. I also developed
the pull interface, wrote regression tests, created the man pages and
other documentation which will integrate command fully into BRL-CAD.</p>
<p>During Final Days and Post-GSoC I plan to finish implementing the
pull_leaf routine which pulls both the scale and rotation components of
primitives for BRL-CAD completing the pull routine and any other new
projects as needed.</p>
<p>This was one of the most exciting summers of my life.</p>
<p>Cheers! Nyah</p>

<h2 id="17-june-23-june">17 June - 23 June</h2>
<p>Coding Begins for GsoC working on codepatch to be uploaded to brlcad
uploaded the sourcefile for new push routine which supports the -x
option for xpush but still needs further testing and modifications.</p>
<p>18 june 2013 Added a new functionality to new push routine where the
push would recognise the the xpush case even in a case where the -x
option is ommitted or ignored.</p>
<p>Tested the new routine and extracted patch to be uploaded to sourceforge
replacing the previous push file I uploaded.</p>
<p>To discuss with mentors whether there is an implementation of the
Inverse of a 4x4 matrix in the brlcad source code.</p>
<p>Looking at the implementations of the Inverse of the matrix in BRL-CAD</p>
<h2 id="24-june-30-june">24 June - 30 June</h2>
<ul>
<li>Monday June 24</li>
</ul>
<p>Looked at the definitions for the inverse of a 4x4 matrix as defined in
/src/libbn/mat.c. However, i realised orthogonal matrices were not taken
into consideration. So added functionality to determine inverse faster
for othogonal matrices and to upload patch to sourceforge shortly.</p>
<p>Started creating structures for the pull routine that is ( pull_obj and
p_solid) structures to hold objects to be pushed and solids currently
being pushed on a CSG tree. Code to be added to sourceforge Shortly.</p>
<p>re-read the HACKING file to make sure i conformed with the coding
standards for BRL-CAD.</p>
<ul>
<li>Tuesday June 25</li>
</ul>
<p>Further tested the bn_mat_inverse routine(src/libbn/mat.c) and
modified patch that was to be uploaded yesterday but failed due to poor
network connection.</p>
<p>Looked at the libbn library especially mat.c which would be useful for
implementing the pull.</p>
<p>Studied the vmath.h header and discovered the transform.c file which
could be applied in creating the pull routine.</p>
<p>Uploaded the pull.c first patch and bn_mat_inverse patches due to
failure in network for them to be uploaded yesterday. <a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/brlcad/patches/202/">Inverse Matrix
support for orthogonal
matrices</a></p>
<p>Will need some clarification from mentors concerning my design strategy
for the pull routine.( The necessary functions i would need to create or
call from the source) in order to implement a complete pull
routine.(Asked on mailing list.) still to continue work on push and
xpush merger.</p>
<p>Saw the importance of magic numbers in taking note of visited nodes
along the CSG tree. Also, thought of checking the matrix transformations
for each node to determine if node has been visited but since magic IDs
were used in the push then i could use both in pull when performing the
inorder walk from the leaf(solid) nodes.</p>
<p>Moreover, for objects in database, dp-&gt;d_uses was used but not safe
as defined push.</p>
<ul>
<li>Wednesday July 26</li>
</ul>
<p>Earlier part of the day used for preparation for and wrote an
Information System test before working.</p>
<p>Added the new pull routine to the setup.c(/src/mged/setup.c) interface
and included the new command into the CMakeLists.txt
file(/src/libged/CMakeLists.txt) in the brlcad source</p>
<p>These patches also included the removal of the xpush command to support
the new push and xpush. Patches to be uploaded to sf.</p>
<p>Added new pull routine declaration(ged_pull(struct ged *,int, char
*[])) to the ged.h header so it can be accessed by other files.
patches to be uploaded to sf.</p>
<p>Added new pull to tclcad_obj.c file(/src/libtclcad/) although with
support of more than one arguments i'll first of all try to test with
only one argument then see how far it goes;this is so that it's
available in the internal database interface.</p>
<p>Added tentative ged_pull() function definition to the pull.c file to
enable it to be accessed by files calling function.</p>
<p>However since ged_pull() routine does not compile code can't compile
due to unused variables so will create some dummy operations just to see
how blank routine works and get it started.</p>
<p>Well just realised that the orthogonal matrix consideration in the
bn_mat_inverse routine in mat.c is causing the benchmark tests to
fail. Gotta sit on it and fix the bug. <a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/brlcad/patches/206/">Pull
Patch</a></p>
<ul>
<li>Thursday 27 June</li>
</ul>
<p>Travelled to Douala and spent the whole day trying to cash the prepaid
GSoC deposit. However, tried working on a bug in the mat.c
file(/src/libbn) where the inserted code patch for orthogonal matrix
support is giving wrong answers during the benchmark test. Discovered a
little error calling the bn_mat_mul2() routine and now code passes 3
benchmark tests and fails 3.Will perfect code and upload codepatch
tomorrow on sf.</p>
<ul>
<li>Friday 28 June</li>
</ul>
<p>Looking at the bn_mat_inv() routine and performing some tests to
ensure all benchmark tests succeed.</p>
<p>Checked the orthogonal matrix support and code still fails 3 regression
tests after testing and checking need some assistance for this. Started
a detail analysis and study of the push command from the ged_push()
routine. This is to enable me understand perfectly the implementation
hacks of the push in order to implement a push correctly especially when
it comes to dealing with the points and matrix transformations at the
node and leaf levels on the CSG tree.</p>
<p>To check all reviews from code patches so as to start working on them
tomorrow. <a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/brlcad/patches/190/">Modified push</a>
<a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/brlcad/patches/202/">Modified
bn_mat_inv</a>This patches
passes some regression tests; but i don't understand why it still
doesn't work perfect. Don't really see the problem here</p>

<li>Monday 1 July</li>
</ul>
<p>Well did not code because of Preparations to attend the Google Student's
Ambassador's Summit in Nairobi, Kenya for Africa. This summit goes on
for the whole week. But will try to fix problems with my code patches
while at the summit.</p>
<ul>
<li>Tuesday 2 July 2013</li>
</ul>
<p>Boarded Kenyan Airways flight from Douala Int'l to the Jomo Kenyatta
Int'l in Nairobi which took about 5 hours; then registered with the GSA
team.</p>
<ul>
<li>Wednesday 3 July 2013</li>
</ul>
<p>Attended the First day of Summit where we had talks with Google
Engineers about being a good ambassador. Presentations were given by Mr.
Obum Ekeke , Tayib Fall and others about opportunities at Google.</p>
<ul>
<li>Thursday 4 July 2013</li>
</ul>
<p>Second Day of Summit focused on Google products like Adwords, Adsense
and other products; also, Engr. Giacomo(Googler) gave a presentation on
Webmaster tools and Google Search in general.</p>
<ul>
<li>Friday 5 July 2013</li>
</ul>
<p>Third day of Summit where we focused on making greater impacts on our
communities in Africa; with awards given to Star GSAs of the previous
years. Shared ideas and experiences for the Moonshot idea competition
organised as per country we emerged 3rd after South Africa and Kenya.
Developed plans to execute our moonshot idea as we returned home after
the summit</p>
<ul>
<li>Saturday 6 July</li>
</ul>
<p>Preparing for return trip to Douala Int'l and went round Nairobi for
shopping and other stuffs.</p>
<ul>
<li>Sunday 7 July</li>
</ul>
<p>Returned from Nairobi to Douala and after meeting family travelled to
Buea to prepare for coming week.</p>
<h2 id="8-july-14-july">8 July - 14 July</h2>
<ul>
<li>8 July 2013</li>
</ul>
<p>Wrote a report to be submitted to the Vice Chancellor concerning my
experiences on Google Student Ambassador's summit and preparing for a
Numerical Analysis Exam Took further look at source code(/src/push.c) to
see how the matrix transformations are applied to the coordinate points
of the node so as to determine a way of extracting the original matrix
transformation or almost exact matrix transformation for source code.</p>
<p>Glad the Dean of the faculty of Science authorized the installation of
Internet in the CS so we can have 24/7 Internet access</p>
<ul>
<li>Tuesday 9 July</li>
</ul>
<p>Wrote my Numerical Analysis exams and to finish with exams tomorrow so i
can focus on GSoC full time.</p>
<ul>
<li>Wednesday 10 July</li>
</ul>
<p>Finished writing exams today and started preparing previous code
patches(mat.c,push.c,pull.c) so that when the Internet access is
available all files will be uploaded so as to get commit access.</p>
<ul>
<li>11 July 2013</li>
</ul>
<p>studied the brlcad primtive internals like(torus, spheroids, toruses
(torii), spheres, ellipsoids, pyramids) so as to be able generate the
original transformation matrix. Torus, struct rt_tor_internal
Centerpoint, point_t v, is obviously the translation. The orientation
and scale is defined by vect_t h, and radiuses by fast_t r_h and
fast_t r_a. Because of symmetries, the original transformation matrix
must have contained a translation of v, and a rotation that brings
vect_t h to an axis</p>
<p>Spheres and ellipsoids, struct rt_ell_internal Centerpoint is at
point_t v, which again is obviously the translation done.There are
three vectors, point_t a, point_t b, and point_t c, that describe the
spheroid axes. This means that I can construct the transformation matrix
that transforms the unit sphere to this sphere directly.</p>
<p>for Truncated general cones, struct rt_tgc_internal Centerpoint is at
vect_t v, with vect_t h describing the axis. The base of the cone is,
I think, described by the vectors vect_t a and vect_t b, and the top
of the cone by vectors vect_t c and vect_t d. This implies that aÂ·b=0
and cÂ·d=0, but they may not be perpendicular to h, since the base and
top of a general cone may be cut along any direction. v is the
translation, and h should be along an axis (probably z axis). This
yields three vectors (h, f, g), that along with the translation vector v
define the transformation matrix just like in the ellipsoid case.</p>
<p>Also, looked at data type for Pyramids: struct rt_arb8_internal This
data type contains between four (tetrahedron) to eight vertices as
point_t variables. Pyramids and tetrahedra have the apex vertex
perpendicular and center to a face. This can be taken as the face
vector. The second vector is one that bisects an edge (the longest
edge?) of the face perpendicular to the apex. The third vector is their
cross product, and is either towards a vertex (a tetrahedron) or halves
another edge of the face perpendicular to the apex (a pyramid). These
three vectors can be used to regenerate the initial transformation
matrix, with e.g. the base on the XY plane, and the apex along the Z
axis.</p>
<p>To look at wedges, Boxes, and convex polyhedra tomorrow.</p>

<li>12 July 2013</li>
</ul>
<p>Prepared complete patches and uploaded to sf to replace the existing
patches for new push routine(push.c), pull routines(pull.c) and
bn_mat_inverse routine(mat.c) with orthogonal matrix support. Since
there is no internet connection, I could not create these patches with
the current svn checkout.</p>
<p>Continued study of implementation of push.c so as to see what happens to
coordinate points of the node, to determine how some form of the
original matrix transformation is stored so as to ease restore during
the pull routine.</p>

<li>13 July 2013</li>
</ul>
<p>Did no work because of a long meeting( in my capacity as Auditor of
Computer Engineering students Association) of over 5 hours with the Dean
of Faculty to draft modalities for new student union body and draft
constitution and mission to govern association.</p>
<p>Will start implementing the pull leaf function as from Monday which will
extract the matrix transformations from the primitives(solid) or leaf
nodes.</p>

<ul>
<li>Took a break so as to recover from malaria.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="sept-09-sept-15">Sept 09 - Sept 15</h2>
<p>Monday 09 October</p>
<ul>
<li>Started looking at AABB bbox routines in BRL-CAD. Still to develop
    simple algorithm that automatically processes the translation from
    bbox return vectors to determine original translation.</li>
</ul>
<!-- -->

<ul>
<li>Read some online wiki pages on AABB bounding box of objects.</li>
</ul>
<p>ToDO: To start writing routine and unit test tomorrow</p>
<p>Tuesday 10 October</p>
<ul>
<li>Started and finished writing tranlate routine which extracts and
    sets the translation component from the bounding box minimum and
    maximum points from the bounding box routine.</li>
</ul>
<!-- -->

<ul>
<li>To integrate general bounding box calculating function for every
    primitive.</li>
</ul>
<p>Wednesday 11 October</p>
<ul>
<li>Started testing pull_leaf routine using the rt_functab bbox
    routine and successfully pulled some translations assuming object's
    centrepoint was translated from the origin(0,0,0). But still waiting
    on Sean for some clarifications on the math.</li>
</ul>
<!-- -->

<ul>
<li>To look at confirmation from sean and perfect the pull_leaf
    routine, completing the pull routine and running through valgrind.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thursday 12 October</p>
<ul>
<li>Perfected math on moving bounding box and primitive to origin before
    extracting translation. But will start testing tomorrow.</li>
</ul>
<p>Friday 13 October</p>
<ul>
<li>Successfully wrote the pull_leaf routine which pulled the
    translation components of the primitive.</li>
</ul>
<!-- -->

<ul>
<li>Tested routine together with the pull_combination routines and
    successfully moved the matrices right up to the root of the tree.
    but still unclear with cases where the matrix transformations for
    the combinations is NAN.</li>
</ul>
<!-- -->

<ul>
<li>Submitted <a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/brlcad/patches/215/">patch</a> on
    sf and awaiting review before moving on to porting command to archer
    since i've not been granted commit access.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="sept-16-sept-22">Sept 16 - Sept 22</h2>
<p>Monday Sept 16,</p>
<ul>
<li>Started re-testing the pull routine starting from the pull_leaf
    which pulled correctly.</li>
</ul>
<!-- -->

<ul>
<li>Discovered a bug with the pull_comb() routine which pulls matrices
    which are not symmetric;so will fix bug tomorrow.</li>
</ul>
<!-- -->

<ul>
<li>Started stubbing pull to archer but had an error will try to fix
    problem tomorrow or post question on mailing list and see what comes
    up.</li>
</ul>
<p>Tuesday Sept 17</p>
<ul>
<li>Continued testing the pull_leaf and realised NAN values were being
    pulled from the primitives which are to be set to zero in such
    cases.</li>
</ul>
<!-- -->

<ul>
<li>Started fixing bug.</li>
</ul>
<p>Wednesday Sept 18</p>
<ul>
<li>Continued fixing pull_leaf routine but realised pull_comb()
    routine pulled matrix transformations having NAN as values. to ask
    mentors about this problem if it persists.</li>
</ul>
<!-- -->

<ul>
<li>Was in a meeting with the Vice Chancellor as Google Student
    Ambassador and explained my Vision for the University during my
    tenure.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thursday Sept 19</p>
<ul>
<li>Started preparing for my upcoming exams next week; and had a meeting
    with the Public relations Officer of the University concerning my
    recent appointment as Google Student Ambassador and plans for the
    University community.</li>
</ul>
<p>Friday Sept 20</p>
<ul>
<li>Attended the Interview at the University Media House( Chariot FM)
    where I explained my GSoC experience and current work as Google
    Student Ambassador.</li>
</ul>
<p>Saturday Sept 21</p>
<ul>
<li>Wrote the Project summary and continued preparing for my exams next
    week.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="sept-23-sept-28">Sept 23 - Sept 28</h2>
<ol>
<li>Monday Sept 23</li>
</ol>
<p>Started looking at the BRL-CAD documentation spreadsheet posted by
Harmanpreet and summarising all documents on the list. Requested for the
script from Harmanpreet that automates the summary of the documents.</p>
<p>@Will finish summarising documents tomorrow; since I have to prepare for
some of my exams coming up from tomorrow.</p></div>
