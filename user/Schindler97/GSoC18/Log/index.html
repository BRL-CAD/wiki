<ul>
<li>Week 2<ul>
<li><strong>21 May</strong><ul>
<li>Introduced bindings and example for the primitive : half</li>
<li>I've understood how typec.in functions</li>
<li>We're trying to figure out the ??? in : tcl -&gt; .g .
    src/mged/setup.c (converts tcl to c commands) -&gt; ???
    -&gt; include/rt/db_io.h -&gt; .g</li>
<li>I learnt about opendb, which calls the f_opendb() function
    defined in src/mged/mged.c. to open and create new
    databases, this will be handy in our pipeline.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>22 May</strong><ul>
<li>Fixed primtive examples for arbx and sph</li>
<li>Did mged tutorials 6-8</li>
<li>Went through libged to understand how it work</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>23 May</strong> :<ul>
<li>Went through Hacking-BRL-CAD, I really wish I had found this
    document way earlier!</li>
<li>Couldn't get a lot of work done because of a research paper
    deadline I'm working on.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>24 May</strong> :<ul>
<li>I've started documenting the project so far. The major
    subtopics I'm documenting are :<ul>
<li>What is python brlcad?</li>
<li>How to setup python brlcad?</li>
<li>How do the different parts of the code work?</li>
<li>Creating geometry using existing primtives</li>
<li>Introducing and experimenting with primitives</li>
<li>Further Work</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>25 May</strong><ul>
<li>Continuing work on the documentation.</li>
<li>I'm still not able to build a page using doxygen, I've
    dropped a message on Zulip and hope to get it resolved soon
    :)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>26-27 May</strong><ul>
<li>Took the weekend off to travel to the beach nearby, Last two
    weeks have been really hectic with GSoC work and my research
    paper deadline nearing up on the first of June!</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>28 May - 4th June</strong><ul>
<li>No major GSoC work was done during this period because of an
    external submission deadline at a research conference.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<!-- -->

<ul>
<li>Week 3<ul>
<li><strong>5 June</strong><ul>
<li>Resumed GSoC work. Had a conversation with @Sean and updated
    him regarding the lag in project.</li>
<li>Revised through libwdb and some sample scripts in src/shapes
    and src/proc-db to get a hang on how .g files can be made
    using libwdb.</li>
<li>The plan now is to introduce a new primitive name "script"
    in librt. As a part of creating it, I'm going to have to
    define the syntax of the scripts that the primitive will
    parse.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>6 June</strong><ul>
<li>Major part of workday so far has been on understanding
    libged/typein.c that deals with the <strong>in command</strong>. I feel
    like we can incorporate a script keyword in this file
    itself. Also, waiting to hear from the mentors about what
    they think of this idea vs incorporating a new primitive.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>7 June</strong><ul>
<li>I've modified scripts in proc-db to better understand how to
    interact with libwdb's API.</li>
<li>I'm also trying to figure out where the logic for the main
    'script' parser would go. I feel like putting it inside
    libwdb would be a logical choice.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>8 June</strong><ul>
<li>SVN has been acting weird today for me, despite multiple
    attempts (20+), I've been unable to checkout the repo. It
    seems to be an issue with my university proxy server but I'm
    not sure yet. I've been messing around a lot and have broken
    something which I can't seem to fix and hence am attempting
    to pull the latest build.</li>
<li>I've been scanning through libged and mged to figure out how
    file upload works in mged. That'll be the first challenge in
    working with the 'script' parser.</li>
<li>Discussion with Sean today is going-on. [To be
    updated] (To_be_updated.md)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>9 June</strong><ul>
<li>Today was majorly spent understanding the ctypesges approach
    as proposed by Kanzure.</li>
<li>ctypesgen seems to be automatically generating bindings for
    the c code and feels like a neat approach.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>10th June</strong><ul>
<li>Sean assisted with a path to fix some installation errors in
    the ctypegen code. It was due to certain missing header
    files.</li>
<li>We were facing issues in installations but once Sean
    explained about how lib_bundles work, I was able to get
    everything running.</li>
<li>I also wrote and submitted a script that does what
    proc-db/wdb_example.c does using the tcl (nmz) approach and
    have submitted it for review. We will not decide whether to
    go ahead with the tcl approach or the ctypesgen one.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Week 4 : Evaluation Period.</li>
</ul>
<!-- -->

<ul>
<li>Week 5<ul>
<li><strong>17th June</strong><ul>
<li>src/tcl/generic/tclParse.c seemed like a good place to
    understand how tcl scripts are parsed. Spent the entire day
    reading this code and trying to understand it.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>18th June</strong><ul>
<li>tclParse.c is very very complicated and I feel like it'll be
    less of a challenge to write the parsing script from
    scratch. I plan to use pyparsing (lib) to create the parser.</li>
<li>Spent the day learning how pyparsing works and going through
    it's tutorial series.</li>
<li>pyparsing requires a BNF of the script format to work with.</li>
<li>I'm planning to use tcl scripts as input for the procedural
    geometry because they are already in use in the BRLCAD
    ecosystem and I don't want to introduce a new file format.</li>
<li>Creating a BNF for tcl is turning out to be a complicated
    job</li>
<li>I've been at this for hours now and finally, I've come
    across this on the TCL website : <a href="http://wiki.tcl.tk/1643">http://wiki.tcl.tk/1643</a>.
    Essentially you cannot have a BNF for TCL.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>19th June</strong><ul>
<li>I'm just going to write a vanilla parser and add
    functionality as modules slowly.</li>
<li>Basic TCL script parsing is working now.</li>
<li><strong>The script parser works with python-brlcad (ctypesgen) to
    read tcl scripts and creating corresponding .g objects</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>20th June</strong><ul>
<li>Changed the structure of the code and refactored it a bit.</li>
<li>Right now arguments in scripts are being passed as constants
    but having variables would be an integral part of procedural
    geometry too.</li>
<li>Changed the primitive creation code so that variable parsing
    can be introduced later.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>21st June</strong><ul>
<li>Some primitives are still remaining in the script parser.
    Adding those and making some finishing touches.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>22nd June</strong><ul>
<li>Introduced arbn and pipe primitives. All primitives are now
    accounted for.</li>
<li>Introduced the ability to parse variables. Procedure
    geometry is all about re-using procedures and creating
    complicated objects easily. Such an approach would require
    the use of variables. Currently variables can be given a
    value and while making shapes these variables are swapped
    out for their values.</li>
<li>I'm handling variables as they're used by tcl scripts.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>23rd June</strong><ul>
<li>Now comes the tough part. I've have to introduce procedures.
    A procedure is any "function" that draws one or more shapes
    and may (usually has) have arguments passed to it that are
    used during shape creation.</li>
<li>After a fair amount of reading, I've decided to go with
    tcl's procedures (http://wiki.tcl.tk/463) definition to
    procedures in the script.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Week 6<ul>
<li><strong>24th June</strong><ul>
<li>Some basic changes in variable parsing. Resolved errors that
    were creeping in due to line spacing/indentation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>25th June</strong><ul>
<li>Writing an interpreter seems to be far more difficult that I
    had imaged. I've been at this for hours now and I can't
    figure out a good enough flow (sequence) in which I should
    parse the different parts of a script.</li>
<li>The major issue seems to be with handling expressions and
    variable substitution within procedures at run-time. To
    tackle this, I've decide to encode each procedure (proc in
    the script) as an object of the procedure class
    (proc_interpreter.py) and initialize it with all the global
    and local variables it might require.</li>
<li>On run-time then expressions would be executed based on the
    arguments passed and the final values would be substituted
    then.</li>
<li><a href="https://compilerdesignblog.wordpress.com/">https://compilerdesignblog.wordpress.com/</a> Has turned out
    to be very helpful. Not directly, but in a way guides you on
    how to tackle the problem.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>26th June</strong><ul>
<li>Introduced proc_finder, responsible for extracting exact
    procedure strings from the script. Used the generic closed
    parenthesis calculation using a stack.</li>
<li>Introduced basic-bone structure for the proc_interpreter.py</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>27th June</strong><ul>
<li>Argument extract from procedures done so far.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>28th June</strong><ul>
<li>I'm trying to create a BNF so that the syntactic parser can
    execute expressions containing variables and constants.
    Though, I've never understood how BNFs work. Time to read
    up! There is a set of tools, called parser generators, which
    accept a grammar as an input and automatically generate a
    parser for you based on that grammar.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>29th June</strong><ul>
<li>Work has started on the arithmetic syntax parser. It will be
    used to evaluate mathematical equations (BODMAS expressions)
    in the procedural scripts.</li>
<li>Introduced a bare bones structure with functionality to add
    and subtract.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>30th June</strong><ul>
<li>There was in issue with white spaces being present in the
    equations, fixed that today.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Week 7<ul>
<li><strong>2nd July</strong><ul>
<li>I wake up on Monday to resume working. Start reading what
    I've written and I feel like : <a href="https://imgur.com/a/DSQNWPt">https://imgur.com/a/DSQNWPt</a></li>
<li>Nonetheless I start adding comments and working finishing
    the parser. I've added functionality to divide and multiple.</li>
<li>Parenthesis are now being taken care of! :)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>3rd July</strong><ul>
<li>I just realized about a massive blunder I've made. I can't
    account for negative or floating point numbers :|. Start
    frantically working on it. Difficult to think around it but
    fairly easy to implement I'd say.</li>
<li>The arithmetic parser is ready. I now import it into the
    script parser and write code to extract "mathematical
    expressions" from the script and feed it to the parser.</li>
<li>Feel like I should document my functions better. Add basic
    description to major functions in script.py</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>4th July</strong><ul>
<li>I've found a bug in how proc structures are being extracted
    from the script. Fixing it should be easy.</li>
<li>Turns out, isn't easy. Still working on a fix (without
    breaking a lot of other things).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>5th July</strong><ul>
<li>Skipped today, didn't do much work today :/</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>6th July</strong><ul>
<li>YES! Procs get extracted properly. The bug was fixed by
    finding the last line of proc-definition, and then using it
    for further tasks.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>7th July</strong><ul>
<li>Now we're extracted procs, time go get started on parsing
    them.</li>
<li>Global variable substitution : Done</li>
<li>Local variable substitution : Done</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Week 8<ul>
<li><strong>9th July</strong><ul>
<li>Expression evaluation within procs using global and local
    variables done.</li>
<li>There is still a bug that creeps in during argument
    substitution (when a proc is called), working on a fix now.</li>
<li>Things are looking good. The entire script parser should be
    ready in a day or two!</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>10th July</strong><ul>
<li>Implemented the python version of sgi.sh</li>
<li>&lt;&lt;Evaluation Period has started! Eeek!&gt;&gt;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>11th July</strong><ul>
<li>Worked on reducing the size of the sgi.py (Made it under 100
    lines)</li>
<li>My approach was not right, better abstractions are expected.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>13th July</strong><ul>
<li>Rounded_rcc procedure implemented and pushed.</li>
<li>Discussion with Sean regarding how the procedural scripts
    will be interacted with.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Week 9<ul>
<li><strong>16th July</strong><ul>
<li>Basic Sanity Checks for the Rounded_rcc procedure are in
    place.</li>
<li>Work to couple the script primitive with the pythonic parser
    starts today!</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>17th July</strong><ul>
<li>Made changes as required to rename files and libraries.</li>
<li>Updated files, tests and examples.</li>
<li>Tested files to make sure nothing is breaking on new build.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>18th July</strong><ul>
<li>Made the spreadsheets that investigate which wdb functions
    are on the python side and which are currently not. Pushed
    this to github as well.</li>
<li>Started work on rt_script_describe(). Reading previous
    primitives and understanding how files work.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>19th July</strong><ul>
<li>Sean has nicely given instruction on what do and they seem
    to be straightforward. I'm having issues with parsing
    strings, I'm using a character array but I'm sure there has
    be a better way.</li>
<li>Modified typein.c to take appropriate input</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>20th July</strong><ul>
<li>I've found something called bu_vls which seems to be
    handling scripts.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Week 10<ul>
<li><strong>23rd July</strong><ul>
<li>Finished work on the excel sheet (added list of primitives
    with mk_primitive function)</li>
<li>Discussion with Sean regarding re-writing my file printing
    code snippet.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>24th July</strong><ul>
<li>The (null) printing was fixed.</li>
<li>Mged now though crashes with Segfault 11 when executing the
    in command for creating script.</li>
<li>Re-wrote the code snippet to modify l describe to print file
    contents.</li>
<li>Can now print file contents with hardcoded file path but
    cannot store file name.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>25th July</strong><ul>
<li>Today's work was more about failing to do a lot of things
    rather than actually being able to do them.</li>
<li>I thought that I was having a problem with the bu_vls
    struct so tried to use a char array to store the filename in
    typein.c.</li>
<li>I then started looking at the code and debugging line by
    line and found the bug. It was occurring because in
    src/librt/primitives/ell.c, fname could not be read from the
    rt_ell_internal struct</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>26th July</strong><ul>
<li>I also spent a considerable amount of time reading through
    import5() and export5() function in dsp.c and ebm.c to
    understand how they handle input strings. A lot of doubts
    were cleared by debugging using bu_log. Have a few major
    doubts, have shared them on the IRC.</li>
<li>The best resources :
    <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/extending/extending.html#calling-python-functions-from-c">https://docs.python.org/3/extending/extending.html#calling-python-functions-from-c</a>,
    <a href="https://www.linuxjournal.com/article/8497">https://www.linuxjournal.com/article/8497</a></li>
<li>Learnt to debug using lldb and also caught my first
    initialization error!</li>
<li>Explored include/bu/file.h to see file opening options.
    bu_temp_file() as Sean suggested is a *possible* way to
    go.</li>
<li>[Minor Task] Compiled and shared list of primitives not
    implemented in python brlcad.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>27th July</strong><ul>
<li>Started working on fixing the script primitive, but even
    there, I'd constantly get a seg fault. I thought they were
    initialization issues and I tried to fix them here and there
    but nothing worked</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Week 11<ul>
<li><strong>30th July</strong><ul>
<li>Created the Tutorial folder in github
    (https://github.com/Killthebug/python-brlcad/tree/master/Tutorial)
    It has currently two files which explain how to create
    shapes procedurally.</li>
<li>abstract_tutorial.py : Uses the draw_primitive file to
    create geometry. Advantage of using it is : better naming of
    functions and easier handling of arguments that are passed.
    This file is tested and complete and creates all shapes.</li>
<li>core_tutorial.py : Used the actual wrappers, without an
    intermediate file. This file is not totally tested and hence
    might break. Will be fixed in the next commit.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>1st August</strong><ul>
<li>Primitives missing from the scene were introduced : bot,
    grip, superell, submodel, ebm.</li>
<li>I tried to create ars and metaball but there seem to be
    issues popping up. I'm fixing them. The issue with metaball
    is something that is followed on from GSoC'14. Look at May
    29 Entry :
    <a href="../../../Krajkreddy/GSOC14/summary/">Krajkreddy/GSOC14/summary</a></li>
<li>With ars and metaball there's some issues on the binding
    side. There was an issue with the fastf_t *verts[5],
    Error :: expected LP_c_double_Array_5 instance instead
    of LP_c_double_Array_5.</li>
<li>Re-arrangements in the scene take up a little more time than
    expected but that's not a major issue.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>2nd August</strong><ul>
<li>Learnt to work with sketch, extrude and revolve in mged.</li>
<li>Moved a few shapes (3) from the z-orientation to the
    y-orientation.</li>
<li>Browsed code to create the script primitive in the python
    API and found what "I think" are some errors. I've changed
    the code a bit and I've almost managed to get it to work. I
    know exactly what to change further (hopefully) and it
    should be up and running in the next commit.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>3rd August - 5th August</strong><ul>
<li>Finally, the scene (with most of the primitives is close to
    completion)</li>
<li>The scene is now along the x-y plane, growing vertically
    along the z-axis.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>6th August</strong><ul>
<li>Refined the arb* constructions in the scene by better
    orienting some and re-drawing some to improve viewing
    angles.</li>
<li>Superell and ebm introduced in the scene.</li>
<li>Progress done on the script primitive front. I've now
    understood that there are 3 different ways to pass arguments
    to the script primitive. Figuring out the exact parameters
    for the points and vertices didn't take very long (\~1.5
    hours because in python data-types are not defined and
    experimenting with logging requires re-installing the entire
    package again and again).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Week 12<ul>
<li><strong>7th August</strong><ul>
<li>Even though I was able to figure out (hopefully) what sort
    of data was required, there are some errors arising in terms
    of unexpected size of params and a clash due to
    multiple-variables coming in with the same name. I was able
    to debug this eventually, though I've had to change the
    original code.</li>
<li>Even after all the arguments are passed, the three
    approaches get stuck at the same place when they try to
    create the curves :

</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>8th August</strong><ul>
<li>The sketch primitive binding (on the ctypesgen end) was
    broken/out-dated.</li>
<li>Although I was able to figure out how to pass arguments,
    there were issues with respect the modules involved.</li>
<li>Thanks a ton to Cezar for pointing out some deprecated
    features, but the errors just won't stop.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>9th August</strong><ul>
<li>Spent some time figuring out the sketch primitive but then
    eventually gave up.</li>
<li>I started writing the describe function for the script
    primitive.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>10th August</strong><ul>
<li>A little into today and I've completed the describe
    function.</li>
<li>There's an issue in rt_script_export5(). This is with
    regard to the space allocated for the buffer
    (ep-&gt;extbytes).</li>
<li>Also, 4 characters seemed to be creeping into the struct
    (rt_script_internal *) script_ip-&gt;s_type variable.
    For now I've handled them by copying the bu_vls to a char
    array and then chopping off the first 4 characters in the
    char array.</li>
<li>script_ip-&gt;s_type still remains to be fixed, but I
    imagine the fix would be minor.</li>
</ul>
</li>
