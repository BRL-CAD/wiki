<ul>
<li>04 May 2020</li>
</ul>
<p>Downloaded Qt, Visual Studio C++, cloned (or whatever it is called in
svn) the BRL-CAD source code.</p>
<ul>
<li>05 May 2020</li>
</ul>
<p>Fixed the errors that came up and built BRL-CAD from source on Windows,
VS2019. Several bugs still remain. A debug assertion failure happens in
pix-bw.exe. But I guess this won't affect my project in any way. The
builds still take a long time. I guess this is because everything is
compiled everytime.</p>
<ul>
<li>06 May 2020</li>
</ul>
<p>I looked at the possibility of using NMake to build BRL-CAD for Windows
because it would not take long as building with VS (CMake was lot faster
when I was doing in Ubuntu last year). Also I need to configure CLion
instead of VS.</p>
<p>CMake generates the NMake project successfully. But NMake does not work
well. It gives an error when building TCL and TK projects. I was
changing various stuff and tried to see if it succeeds.</p>
<ul>
<li>07 May 2020</li>
</ul>
<p>Changing CMakeLists files of tcl and tk modules and a change to
corecrt_io.h in windows 10 SDK made the errors with NMake disappear.
Archer does not work. Debugging Archer displays that it crashes saying
tkhtml.dll not found. Also I was trying to find a bug to solve as the
patch Sean asked for. Looked at
<a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/brlcad/bugs/385/">https://sourceforge.net/p/brlcad/bugs/385/</a>. Followed some Qt videos.</p>
<ul>
<li>08 May 2020</li>
</ul>
<p>I was thinking the only command line way of building using Visual Studio
was via NMake. I realized that I can build via the Visual Studio IDE's
native way by setting some arguments in CMake. Also realized that the
build times were long when building with VS IDE was because I built
ALL_BUILD when I should have built only the target I changed.
Configured CLion to use VS IDE's tools to build. Everything is working
now.</p>
<ul>
<li>09 May 2020</li>
</ul>
<p>Worked on the patch Sean had asked for. The Create new file in MGED had
a bug. It was saving without the .g extension even though .g extension
was selected in the Create New dialog box (at least on Windows). I tried
to debug this. I realized this was a bug (or a unusual behavior) in Tk
framework and cannot be by changing BRL-CAD code.</p>
<p>Then I started to create the feature to open recent files in MGED.</p>
<ul>
<li>10 May 2020</li>
</ul>
<p>Finished implementing opening recent files for MGED.</p>
<p>The patch can be found here.
<a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/brlcad/patches/542/">https://sourceforge.net/p/brlcad/patches/542/</a></p>
<ul>
<li>11 May 2020</li>
</ul>
<p>I did not do anything related to the project.</p>
<ul>
<li>12 May 2020</li>
</ul>
<p>Qt is using qmake to build by default. But can be configured to use
CMake too. I encountered several issues when trying to configure
building Qt applications with CMake in Windows. I fixed those issues and
built a Qt based project with CMake.</p>
<ul>
<li>01 June 2020</li>
</ul>
<p>Implemented opening a BRLCAD database and saving a BRLCAD database using
coreinterface.</p>
<p>Used QGLWidget to display geometry using the display manager I
implemented last year. Traversing world with keyboard seems to be
broken.</p>
<ul>
<li>02 June 2020</li>
</ul>
<p>Bug fixes relating to displaying geometry.</p>
<p>Created a class to store and process multiple BRLCAD databases (to
support keeping multiple documents opened inside the software)</p>
<ul>
<li>03 June 2020</li>
</ul>
<p>Implemented fetching objects list from a database using
BRLCAD::ConstDatabase::TopObjectIterator. Displayed the list in a
QListWidget.</p>
<p>However this does not still display the nested objects. Added keyboard
shortcuts for menu item actions.</p>
<ul>
<li>04 June 2020</li>
</ul>
<p>Disabled AUTOMOC and wrapped manually.</p>
<p>Replaced QGLWidget with QOpenGLWidget for displaying geometry and fixed
the bugs that came up.</p>
<p>Readability improvements (Moved .h files to include directory. Made the
CMakeList.txt file clear.)</p>
<p>Created the GitHub repository and pushed everything.</p>
<ul>
<li>05 June 2020</li>
</ul>
<p>Fixed bug OpenGL widget not refreshing after first drawing.</p>
<p>Geometry Operations (Creating sphere)</p>
<ul>
<li>06 June 2020</li>
</ul>
<p>I was struggling to get elements from the VectorList class. Iterator has
a very weird syntax. After hours of googling I could finally print the
values from a VectorList. Had to create a separate class just to do the
iterating (VectorList::Iterate). I'm not sure if I'm doing this
correctly. Can't still get the elements to a list without using
something like global variables since local variables are not accessible
within the class I created for iterating.</p>
<ul>
<li>07-10 June 2020</li>
</ul>
<p>Started rewriting the display manager since I anyway will need to change
it to make compatible with the VectorList.</p>
<p>Created a camera and implemented following functionalities.</p>
<p>Rotating with mouse. Currently configured to rotate by dragging with
middle mouse button.</p>
<p>Moving (perpendicular to the camera direction) with mouse. Currently
configured to move by dragging with right mouse button</p>
<p>Moving forward /backward (camera looking direction) with mouse wheel.</p>
<p>Implemented making the cursor (mouse) jump to the other edge when it
passes the boundary of opengl display while doing the above operations.</p>
<p>Implemented Grid lines.</p>
<p>Keyboard shortcuts for camera.</p>
<ul>
<li>11 June 2020</li>
</ul>
<p>Implemented the class Document which holds information about a single .g
file opened in the editor.</p>
<p>Implemented support for multiple documents. Several .g files can be
opened and worked with now.</p>
<p>Struggled to get the elements from VectorList to a list. (later found
out that this was not possible and was not the intended use of
VectorList)</p>
<ul>
<li>12 June 2020</li>
</ul>
<p>Worked on the DM</p>
<ul>
<li>13 June 2020</li>
</ul>
<p>Finished writing DM to coreinterfaces:VectorList.</p>
<p>bug fixes in coreinterface.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../../img/Arbalest2.png" /></p>
<ul>
<li>14 June 2020</li>
</ul>
<p>Minor Bug fixes. Opening file via QFileDialog::getOpenFileName did not
work when QMdiArea is in subwindow mode rather than tabbed. (For the
screenshot yesterday I had to hard code file paths &amp; open them in
opening).</p>
<ul>
<li>15 June 2020</li>
</ul>
<p>Replaced the objects list with a tree view (I reused the code from rt3 /
QtGui).</p>
<p>Studied the Cameras in g3d. It appears I will have to study the logic
and implement the cameras (rather than reusing the g3d code) since they
use ORGE.</p>
<ul>
<li>16 June 2020</li>
</ul>
<p>Added a style sheet through RC. UI improvements (mostly experimenting
various things I can do with style sheets)</p>
<ul>
<li>17 June 2020</li>
</ul>
<p>Implemented rendering directly from bn_vlist. Now we can choose between
using VectorList and bn_vlist by changing bool
ArbalestSettings::useLegacyVlists.</p>
<p>It turned out to be significantly faster.</p>
<ul>
<li>18-19 June 2020</li>
</ul>
<p>Studied how archer, mged, libged, libtclcad, libdm and display_lists
works.</p>
<p>I was playing around with the code by placing breakpoints in the code of
these libraries while doing stuff in archer.</p>
<ul>
<li>22-23 June 2020</li>
</ul>
<p>Studied the source code.</p>
<p>Worked on implementing display lists in C++.</p>
<p>Cloning and setting up qtged branch. Tried to get qged target to build,
failed.</p>
<ul>
<li>24 June 2020</li>
</ul>
<p>Display lists and managing color done. <img alt="" src="../../img/Arbalestj25.png" /></p>
<p>Removed the C like vlist rendering since BRLCAD::VectorList::Iterate is
now fast enough with Display lists implemented.</p>
<p>Worked on object insert toolbar.</p>
<ul>
<li>25-26 June 2020</li>
</ul>
<p>Implemented line styling (setLineAttr in dm and deciding style for each
solid). Dashed lines are plotted where necessary now.</p>
<p>Ported my DM to the qged project in the main repo. Most of the things
had to be changed since my implementation was on top of coreinterfaces
and the main repo didn't have access to coreinterfaces. So I rewrote it
to rely on the C methods.</p>
<ul>
<li>28-29 June 2020</li>
</ul>
<p>Restructured the code (which is now in main BRLCADrepository / qged) to
seperate the raw OpenGL commands to a new DisplayManager class which is
analogous dms in libdm. The plan is to implement methods in dm-generic.c
in this class as needed.</p>
<ul>
<li>30 June 2020</li>
</ul>
<p>Fixed the bug which prevented the wireframes from not being drawn in
starseeker's machine. After a lot of searching I realized that doing
OpenGL operations in Qt SLOT call cause the bug.</p>
<p>Installed Ubuntu, configured the environment and built BRLCAD+my project
on a virtual machine. (this was done to simulate starseeker's
environment although it would help me in the future to check cross
platform support)</p>
<ul>
<li>1 July 2020</li>
</ul>
<p>Changed my project code in the RT^3 repository to account for to
reimplement the changed made to the code in qged. (see 28-29 June 2020)</p>
<ul>
<li>2-3 July 2020</li>
</ul>
<p>Implemented traversing the database. Basically a C++ wrapper for
db_walk_tree. A class TreeLeaf was implemented to support the
functionality. The feature was implemented to coreinterfaces. A
WalkTree() method was implemented in ConstDatabase.</p>
<p><a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/brlcad/patches/546/">https://sourceforge.net/p/brlcad/patches/546/</a></p>
<p>Implemented methods into GeometryRenderer to utilize the functions I
implemented in coreinterface for drawing the database.</p>
<ul>
<li>4-6 July 2020</li>
</ul>
<p>I realized the coreinterface already had a way to support iterating the
database. Discarded the code I implemented and studied the existing
methods.</p>
<p>Implemented methods into GeometryRenderer to utilize the existing
functions for drawing the database.</p>
<ul>
<li>7-9 July 2020</li>
</ul>
<p>Removed all references to internal C pointers from the codebase.</p>
<p>Changed all occurrences of auto keywords to the corresponding type.</p>
<p>Implemented destructers and properly freeing of memory in all necessary
the classes (I had not done this earlier).</p>
<p>Converted pointers to references where possible for readability.</p>
<p>Implemented the concept Active document, object tree updates when active
document changes. Bug fixes at file open.</p>
<p>Seperated UI files in the project structure for readability. Switched to
manual UIC from AUTO_UIC.</p>
<p>Added and customized stylesheet. Removed titlebar. Added archer icon
into the menubar (now title bar).</p>
<p>Implemented close button into menubar (with on hover/press UI changes)</p>
<p>It looks with the title bar removed. But Now I can't resize / drag the
window at least on Windows.</p>
<ul>
<li>10-16 July 2020</li>
</ul>
<p>Added minimize, maximize, restore buttons (UI changes based on hover /
press state, functionality implementing).</p>
<p>Replaced MDI with a tabbed interface.</p>
<p>Implemented method setBGColor into DisplayManager.</p>
<p>Replaced brlcad/vmath.h with QMatrix4x4 and QVector3D.</p>
<p>Created a preprocessor for QSS to support variables. Color scheme
mapping is stored in a seperate *.theme file now.</p>
<p>Seperated logic for dock widgets into a new class 'Dockable'.</p>
<p>Implemented changes to object tree to support properties displaying.</p>
<p>File open/close UI changes.</p>
<p>Created Properties widget.</p>
<p>Made the UI compatible for multiple screen resolutions and scale levels.</p>
<p>Opening files by passing path.</p>
<p>Scroll related bug fixes in Dockable.</p>
<p>Scrollbars styles to look better and be more space efficient</p>
<p>Implemented CollapsibleWidget</p>
<p>A lot of experimenting in the Stylesheet for everything in the list
above.</p>
<p>Learning about fonts and using them in Qt.</p>
