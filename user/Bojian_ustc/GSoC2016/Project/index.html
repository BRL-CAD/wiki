<p><strong>Name:</strong> Bojian Wu</p>
<p><strong>Email:</strong> ustcbjwu[AT]gmail.com</p>
<p><strong>IRC:</strong> boj</p>
<h2 id="background">Background</h2>
<p>I am currently a first year PhD student majoring in computer graphics in
Chinese Academy of Science, Graduate School, China. My research topics
include geometry processing and modeling, it is very interesting and
attractive to me. Modeling techniques, which are basis for lots of
applications, cover a large range of industrial products, including CAD,
3D printing, computer animations, rendering and so on. Recently, I am
working on a project about geometry modeling, it contains some basic
operations in solid modeling system, so I want to learn more and improve
myself.</p>
<h2 id="brief-summary">Brief Summary</h2>
<p>BRL-CAD currently has a routine to compute plate mode BoT raytracing,
and generally, it works well. But the BoT is the most simplest case,
usually, it can not be used to describe the models with high precision
requirement. To this end, the boundary representation (B-rep) modeling
is proposed, but it does not support the plate mode, so actually, the
B-rep model can not form a solid volume but just a thin surface.</p>
<p>In this project, I would like to implement the plate mode for NURBS
raytracing, cause it is very important for ray tracing and other related
applications. Since it is not an easy task, lots of tests and
verifications are needed, and it also involves designing basic data
structure, importing/exporting data, intersection tests and so on, so I
need to think it more and currently give a short summary about what I
plan to do and some simple solutions here. If time is enough, I will
consider how to visualize the plate mode and design some interactive
commands used in ‘mged’.</p>
<h2 id="project-details">Project Details</h2>
<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>
<p>In Constructive Solid Geometry (CSG) system, the modeling process is
usually represented as boolean operations of some basic primitives such
as cubes, spheres, etc. This method is often used in solid modeling
system and its operations always construct the basic solid modeling
pipeline.</p>
<p>Besides, the boundary representation (B-rep) is also a method for
representing models by using a collection a connected surface elements.
So for the purpose of solid modeling, it is commonly impractical to
represent these thin solids exactly as bounded volume, thus an available
approach is to assign an implicit thickness to each face and then we can
consider the thickness as a face property. Simply speaking, when
shooting a ray towards the B-rep model, we can get ‘in’ and ‘out’ hit
point from a face while the ‘out’ hit point is a small offset from the
‘in’ one with given thickness value along the ray direction.</p>
<p>Currently, BRL-CAD implements this modeling technique in BoT primitive
and refer it as ‘plate mode’. This project is aiming at implementing
‘plate mode’ for NURBS surfaces.</p>
<h3 id="current-work">Current Work</h3>
<p>Currently, BRL-CAD has implemented plate mode raytracing in BoT
primitive.</p>
<h3 id="short-plans">Short Plans</h3>
<p>Following the implementation of plate mode of BoT, I have divided my
plans into several parts, and will illustrate each part individually.</p>
<ul>
<li>Basic data structure</li>
</ul>
<p>The basic problem is about how to integrate these additional attributes,
including face mode and thickness value, into current
‘rt_brep_internal’ and ‘brep_specific’ data structure. At present,
the ‘brep’ is represented as openNURBS ‘ON_Brep’, which is an internal
data structure defined in openNURBS, so it is not so elegant to add
these attributes into ‘ON_Brep’ directly. But as mentioned before, the
thickness value is an implicit property of each face, so maybe it is
more reasonable to add it into ‘ON_Brep’. Currently, I just add the
face mode and thickness value in ‘rt_brep_internal’ and
‘brep_specific’, because by doing this, it is more easier for me to
follow the code. Next, I need to find a balance between these two
representations.</p>
<ul>
<li>Database import and export</li>
</ul>
<p>After defining the basic data structure, we need to consider how to
import/export the database. The related functions are
‘rt_brep_import5()’ and ‘rt_brep_export5()’. Similar to BoT, when we
create NURBS with given thickness, we can provide the parameters in
command line, then we have several options on how to assign the
thickness value to each face. The basic method is to give the same
thickness value to each face. Other options may consider the curvature,
normal or some specific surface properties and design an adaptive method
to finish the assignment, it is a balance between global thickness and
per-face thickness.</p>
<p>Besides, ‘rt_brep_import5()’ and ‘rt_brep_export5()’ provide the
transformation interface between internal and external data structure, I
also need to pay attention to the transformation format.</p>
<ul>
<li>Ray tracing preparation</li>
</ul>
<p>When obtaining internal data structure ‘rt_db_internal’, we need to
copy data to ‘brep_specific’ in ‘rt_brep_prep()’, it is used for data
preparation when doing ray tracing.</p>
<p>Besides, instead of building BVH (Bounding Volume Hierarchy) to generate
surface tree, it may be more efficient to find the bounding boxes of all
the faces in the face list of ‘brep’, when doing ray tracing, we only
need to find the final intersected bounding box and compute the
intersection hit point.</p>
<ul>
<li>Ray tracing</li>
</ul>
<p>1) Ray intersection with surface</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../../../img/Figure_1.png" /></p>
<p>Figure 1: Ray intersection with surface.(a) Incident ray at normal
direction precisely. (b) Incident ray deviating normal direction in a
certain angle.</p>
<p>As implemented in BoT, similarly, we have two methods to compute the
‘in’ and ‘out’ hit point. The first one is to consider the real hit
point as the ‘in’ point, then offset it with thickness value along the
ray direction and generate the ‘out’ point. The second one is to treat
the real hit point as a middle point, then offset it both along the ray
direction and its opposite direction with half of thickness value, so
that we can generate two points and make them as ‘in’ and ‘out’ hit
point, respectively.</p>
<p>Taking the first method as an example, as shown in Figure 1, we denote
dray as normalized direction of incident ray, dn as normalized normal
direction of ‘in’ hit point, pin as ‘in’ hit point and pout as ‘out’ hit
point. Then in Figure 1(a), pout=pin+dray*thickness. In Figure
1(b),pout≈pin+dray*thickness&lt;dray, -dn&gt; where, &lt;dray,-dn&gt;
represents the inner product of dray and -dn.</p>
<p>2) Ray intersection with corner.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../../../img/Figure_2.png" /></p>
<p>Figure 2: Ray intersection with corner. Because of the corner, which is
formed by intersection of two discrete surfaces, it is not so easy to
estimate the normal direction of intersected point with incident ray,
like the ‘in’ hit point marked as blue in (a) and (b).(a) Incident ray
shooting in one direction. (b) Incident ray shooting in another
direction.</p>
<p>Sometimes, the incident ray may shoot the corner area, like an edge,
formed by the intersection of two discrete surfaces, as shown in Figure
2. Thus, the normal of ‘in’ hit point is not continuous and not so easy
to estimate, so here we can not adopt the method illustrated previously
to compute the ‘out’ hit point.</p>
<p>Let us take Figure 2(b) as a more general example, then we add some
notations in order to clarify the problem as shown in Figure 3.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../../../img/Figure_3.png" /></p>
<p>Figure 3: Figure 2(b) with notations for clarifying how to generate the
‘out’ hit point.</p>
<p>We denote S1 as left parametric surface, and S1' as the offsetted left
parametric surface, same as S2 and S2'. Besides, P1 is ‘in’ hit point,
P2 is the intersection point of incident ray and S1', and P3 is the
intersection point of incident ray and S2'. Clearly, we know P3 should
be the ‘out’ hit point. That is to say, after intersection test with
both two offsetted parametric surfaces, what we need to do is to find
the last intersection point along the incident ray direction.</p>
<p>3) Detection of intersection with corner. We can use the method
illustrated in 2) to generate ‘out’ hit point in 1), but as we all know,
it’s more complex to do intersection test of ray and surface, so I
separate them into two categories, and give different solutions.
Clearly, the method in 1) is more simpler. But here comes the most
critical problem, how to detect the intersection with corner?</p>
<p>Usually, the point normals on one single parametric surface should
satisfy C1 andC2 continuity, but as illustrated in 2), if the model
contains two or more separated surfaces, then the edge, formed by
intersection of two discrete surfaces, should not satisfy this
condition. This is the basic premise of the problem.</p>
