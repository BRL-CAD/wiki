<h2 id="librecad-3-lua-plugin-system">LibreCAD 3 Lua plugin system</h2>
<h3 id="brief-project-summary">Brief project summary</h3>
<p>During the GSoC 2016, I began a simple implementation of Lua plugins.
They offer a GUI version with preview of what could be done before with
the LibreCAD command line. The plugins can only add primitive entities
to a document, others operations are difficult to program, and won’t be
intuitive for the user.</p>
<p>This project aims at improving this plugin system. The plugins could
create new entities types, and define custom interactions.</p>
<p>For example, the rectangle plugin is only adding 4 lines in the
document. After that, individual lines can be modified, and it doesn’t
look like a rectangle anymore. Here the script should handle the
modification of the entity so it will always remain a rectangle.</p>
<p>The plugins could also make operations on files, which would allow
scripts to import or export different formats.</p>
<p>The same Lua code could be run in LibreCAD, or in command line or in a
quick script, and have the same result.</p>
<p>This proposal is also including drawing optimizations for LibreCAD, and
a unit test system for entities rendering.</p>
<h3 id="detailed-project-description">Detailed project description</h3>
<h4 id="implementation-of-new-plugins">Implementation of new plugins:</h4>
<p>First, the Lua script system needs to be improved. For the moment each
file is included by the Lua UI.</p>
<p>The current implementation has some limits for security reasons. Some
functions were modified or removed. It is currently impossible to read
or write a file, and some plugins can make LibreCAD crash.</p>
<p>The solution here is to run each plugin on its own instance. Some
function currently defined in Lua would be moved to a C++ API accessible
from the scripts. This includes the function to get the selected layer
and metadata. New managers will be required in C++ because actually
these information are only available in the Lua UI.</p>
<p>The API needs to be integrated in the command line and in the quick
script dialog. Currently, they only have an access to the bindings of
the kernel entities.</p>
<p>A plugin manager would be required in the lcadluascript library,
currently everything is done in the Qt UI library, which makes it
inaccessible from the command line.</p>
<p>It would implement methods to start or stop a script, add the bindings,
etc... Some needs to be implemented in the UI, for example the method to
write a file, which will open a dialog in the GUI, and read console
input in the command interface.</p>
<p>The files operations needs to be secure, when a script needs to open or
save a file, it will ask the user where is the file, which prevent
opening sensitive files.</p>
<p>For the automation scripts, it could operate on the files in a specific
folder, like PHP does with open_basedir.</p>
<p>The plugins will all inherit of a Lua class, with a separation between
UI functions and rendering functions, so the same plugin could easily be
used in the GUI and in the command line.</p>
<h3 id="implementation-of-custom-entities">Implementation of custom entities:</h3>
<p>This project will also add custom entities, which could be defined by
scripts, with custom interactions. They would be associated to a block
for the drawing, and allthe data would be included in the INSERT entity.</p>
<p>I think this is the best representation, because LibreCAD will treat the
custom entities like the other CAD programs, which will make the
entities always look the same on two different programs, only the
interactions won’t be available. If a block is modified outside
LibreCAD, it will be visible in LibreCAD too, and they could be
regenerated by the user.</p>
<p>This representation is also required because otherwise it would add Lua
as a dependency.</p>
<p>The interactions with the custom entities includes:</p>
<p>• New elements in the right click menu</p>
<p>• Apparition of new buttons in the toolbar</p>
<p>• Modification of the entity with their drag points</p>
<p>• New snap points</p>
<p>The kernel require the implementation of Blocks and INSERT entities. The
data will be stored in the INSERT entity in the application defined
group (code 102). The plugins can define their own code, only one will
be reserved for LibreCAD with the plugin name.</p>
<h4 id="drawing-order-and-optimizations">Drawing order and optimizations:</h4>
<p>A drawing order needs to be added as, actually, it is random. It wasn’t
an issue before because we were using only basic entities, but now with
the implementation of images, this is also needed.</p>
<p>LibreCAD 3 is redrawing everything each time the cursor is moved, some
objects don’t need to be refreshed every time (like the grid). This
could be improved by redrawing only what’s needed. For example, moving
the cursor should only refresh the temp entities and the cursor.</p>
<p>The last optimization is the transfer between Cairo and Qt. Currently,
there are multiple Cairo painters, which are each transferred to a
QImage, and a QPainter is drawing each QImage on LCADViewer widget.</p>
<p>The addition of the layers could be done in Cairo and drawn directly in
the widget with a custom painter.</p>
<h4 id="rendering-unit-tests">Rendering unit tests:</h4>
<p>The idea here is to use LibreCAD command line to generate images of
rendered entities, and compare them to existing images (what we expect).</p>
<p>We can use a program to compare the differences between the images, but
I’m not sure it will be portable. If that’s not possible, we can compare
them using subtraction. Removing image2 from image1 should result in a
totally black image. The result can be expressed in percentage: 100% –
percentage of white pixels which stayed.</p>
<h3 id="deliverables">Deliverables</h3>

drawer</p>
<p>• Load and save BLOCK/INSERT/custom entities</p>
