<p>'''''7th July</p>
<ul>
<li>Can store files in a separate directory, but could not find a way to

    uploaded g-files at once, also tried to get it working for file
    whenever it's uploaded.</li>

    transformWrite handler and creating a new FS.File object for each
    OBJ file. I have been able to get transformWrite handler working but
    facing some problems with creating new FS.File object.</li>
</ul>
<p>'''''13th July</p>
<ul>
<li>Whenever I created new FS.File object, I got this weird error about
    meteor fibers. So I learnt more about how "non-blocking" code works
    and what are meteor fibers but still I could not make it work.</li>
<li>I posted my problem as issue on CollectionFS github. There, I got
    another logic to work on. Now instead of transform write I was to
    work on "stored" listener.
