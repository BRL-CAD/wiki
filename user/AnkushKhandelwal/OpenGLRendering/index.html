<p><strong>Improve OpenGL Rendering</strong></p>
<p><strong>GSOC Proposal 2015</strong></p>
<p>Brief Description: The Objective of the project is to Re-factor and
re-write the existing code of OpenSCAD preferably by implementing or
using an existing rendering/scenegraph framework for cleaner rendering
code. This newly developed infrastucture can be imported to softwares
like GLES2 which opens up more possibilities like WebGL and native
support for ARM Linux platforms that usually only provide GLES2
implementation.</p>

<h3 id="brief-summary">Brief Summary</h3>
<ul>
<li>The Main Objective of the project is to get a cleaner rendering code
    and also better support and better responsiveness for bigger models.
    The current rendering infrastructure of OpenSCAD is scattered around
    with various bits partially belonging to external packages (CGAL,
    OpenCSG)and the usage of OpenGL in many places degrade rendering
    performance of large models. Hence It is required to re-factor and
    re-write the existing infrastructure.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="detailed-description">Detailed Description</h3>
<ul>
<li>For the above described project following features and task needs to
    be done.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Identify Goals and Requirements</strong></p>
<p>First and foremost task needs to be done is collecting info about
existing OpenGL frameworks which have many advantages as well as
disadvantages compared to OpenScad. By understanding them, we are able
to identify what are the goals that needs to be achieved and also what
problems can arise in meeting those goals. Here is a wiki page
displaying some information about the same :
<a href="https://github.com/openscad/openscad/wiki/Information-About-Other-Frameworks">https://github.com/openscad/openscad/wiki/Information-About-Other-Frameworks</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Spliting the OpenGL code in Different classes - CODE EXTRACTION</strong></p>
<p>We need to split out the openGL code from the polyset classes and all
other classes and make a different class or data structure and it is
used directly. In All it should be a seperate component which takes
objects (for example , polyset) and renders it, in an effort to isolate
the rendering from the rest of the software. The code of OpenSCAD is in
openGL 2 and 1.1 + extentions and also we have users on openGL 2 and
openGL 1.1 + extentions , so abstracting away OpenGL extensions and
version differences is important.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../../img/Diagram.png" /></p>
<p>If we know exactly how much GL code is in a file , the next step would
be to turn it into a separate component, i.e. a class or set of
functions that take a polyset as parameter and renders it. This will
help in making the main files of openSCAD, free from rendering, there
will be a separate component for rendering. This class would then be
responsible for converting polyset data into something more suitable for
OpenGL.For example it does not make sense to render one single object in
OpenGL ,it is not even supported in mordern OpenGL without enabling
legacy compatibility. To enhance our understanding on code extraction we
take an example. Below we have a function from file polyset.cc which is
used in rendering edges, now we want to separate it from the polyset.cc
file such that the moved code is not allowed to use any private methods
or any member variables of polyset.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../../img/Polyset.png" /></p>
<p>To do that we take this function to another file and we create a
renderer class and add API to polyset to enable that rendering class to
extract the data. The renderer can now compile a VBO from that data and
render that (plus cache the VBO so it can be reused if the polyset
doesn’t change). See below patch for practicle application. Then, in the
future, when we use a real OpenGL framework, the renderer will most
likely build a VBO using classes internal to that specific rendering
framework all the VBO stuff would then be built without having to make
any changes to the PolySet class. If we can compile for example polyset
without actually having OpenGL (e.g. on GLES2 box like Chromebook) in it
then it will be a measure of success of code extraction.</p>
<p>A patch has been submitted in which the OpenGL code is in one file and
other renderin code is in another :
<a href="https://github.com/openscad/openscad/pull/1249">https://github.com/openscad/openscad/pull/1249</a></p>
<p><strong>Selecting Scenegraph/Rendering Library</strong></p>
<p>Selecting the most suitable Library which can be integrated with the
newly developed code will require some research about the existing
libraries. In openSCAD OpenGL ES2 is not yet supported, till now
immediate-mode opengl is used. The Goal of this scene-graph library
would be to provide rendering data structure to abstract buffer objects
and also to manage Qt event mappings to camera. By the help of this
library the internal segments of openSCAD will be entirely independent
of rendering. This Library will help to refactor internal OpenSCAD code
instead of the current rendering used in OpenSCAD. The Rendering using
the Library will be more simple and clean, it will be helpful for
calling CGAL objects, Polyset objects and helper objects like axis
display. With this library many features can be implemented like the
speeding up of OpenGL 3d mesh drawing etc.</p>
<p><strong>Off-Screen Rendering</strong></p>
<p>This is another feature which is very important. There should be
GUI-less off-screen rendering which means without the window we can do
rendering and it should work on desktop as well as on headless VMs. The
only requirement is that it works on all desktop OS’es and headless
Linux, but better headless support is a priority.</p>
<p><strong>View-model</strong></p>
<p>The next step could be to create a “view model” for storing
OpenGL-centric data structures for efficient rendering. The main purpose
of making view model is for rendering views, so we can use this to store
all the OpenGL related component so that we have better rendering.
Another important task would be to convert the polyset into a better
data structure for rendering, and use that data structure from the
OpenGL code so that the opengl code isn’t referencing PolySet at all
that would make it easier to create a separation between the Model and
the View.</p>
<h2 id="timeline">TIMELINE</h2>
<p>This timeline is tentative, depends upon the status of the work done:</p>
<p><strong>Get to Know the Community</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Talk to the community members.</li>

    and understanding it.</li>
<li>Deep understanding of code, where the functions are called and where
    the objects are made.</li>
<li>Starting separating openGL code from the various files.</li>
<li>Going on with two implementations - old and new. Old one will be
    intact.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Week 4(June 15)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Only the rendering part is separated, nothing else, excellent
    knowledge of c++ will be required.</li>

    either a class or data structures.</li>
<li>Linking the rendering code to the main infrastructure begins.</li>
<li>Making a renderer class.</li>
<li>adding API to polyset to enable that rendering class to extract the
    data from the main files.</li>

<p><strong>Week 5(June 22)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Making a seperate segment ( either a renderer class or a data
    structure ).</li>
<li>These classes will be public, so that we can inherit the same in
    multiple files.</li>
<li>Extracting the OpenGL code from the various classes like polyset
    etc.</li>
<li>Now the original files does not contain OpenGL code, all the OpenGL
    code is written in separate files.</li>

engagements, also I can spend more time according to the work
requirement.</p>
<h3 id="emailmailing-list">Email/Mailing List</h3>
<p>My email address is ankush.rawat95@gmail.com, I have subscribed to both
brlcad and openscad mailing lists. I have been in contact through these
mailing lists and irc channel with other community members.</p>
<h3 id="real-time-contact">Real-Time Contact</h3>
<p>I am interacting with the mentors through OpenSCAD's IRC
channel(#openscad) on freenode. My nick name on IRC is ank_95 . I am
comfortable with talking to my mentor via telephone if needed. <strong>Contact

<h2 id="why-openscad">Why OpenSCAD?</h2>
<p>OpenSCAD is an open source CAD software application used to make 3D
solid models. It has various applications in mechanical, civil,
electronics and designing hardware tools for research and education
purposes. The software has potential to be used by the large number of
professionals and hardware developers. I like ths community beacause it
is related to graphics, geometry and this it the first time I am
contributing in opensource world and participating in GSOC. And I think
IRC is the best way of communication with the mentors, I feel very
comfortable asking questions to them on IRC(#openscad) and also discuss
about new ideas.</p>
<h2 id="why-opengl-rendering-project">Why OpenGL Rendering Project?</h2>
<p>After I decided to work under this community, I explored various
projects and this projects fascinated me and I thought that I am able to
this project as I like C++ a lot and understands it better. I am pretty
sure that I will able to do this project and if I do not know something
I will learn it and apply in the project. I have looked through the
code, various classes and libraries and understood it. After the
completion, we can import the code and use it in other software like
WebGL etc.</p>
<h2 id="why-me">Why Me?</h2>
<p>I am very interested in programming and very enthusiastic about
contributing in open source community.I like c++ a lot and working with
it in past 2-3 yrs.Graphics is the another field that interests me a
lot, I have a passion toward graphics and if I am given with the
opportunity , even after the submission of project I would love to
contribute in more projects for the community. I have already started
working on this project and also in touch with project mentors. Also I
can come up with new ideas and love to solve some real world problems. I
will apply my full potential in doing the project, submitting every
patch before deadline.I like OpenGL and like to use software for
rendering 2d and 3d model designing so I know what are the things that
user wants while using them.</p>
<h2 id="risk-assessment">RISK-ASSESSMENT</h2>
<p>One particular challenge that comes in my mind is about developing
scenegraph rendering library. We have to take two implementations with
us, one with using the library and another without using the library.
This Library will change the current openSCAD to an another level but if
the project fails then we have to go on with the old implementation of
immediate mode OpenGL. The challenges I see in the project are when it
comes to import the code in softwares like GLES2 . Another challenge
will come when it comes to chose/create a library to provide rendering
data structures to the buffer objects. One challenge will also arise as
the users are used to the old implementation of rendering objects, they
are not used to the new implementation.</p>

<p>Here are some functionality that could be enabled if the project is
successful:</p>
<ul>
<li>GUI object inspection (e.g. highlight bbox, size of imported STLs).</li>
<li>Pick object in 3D window and highlighting in the code.</li>
<li>Pick object in the code and highlight in the 3D window.</li>
