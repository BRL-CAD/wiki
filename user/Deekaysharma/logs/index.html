<h2 id="may-25">May 25</h2>
<ul>
<li>I have decided to work with the landing page, the first and the
    foremost requirement.</li>
<li>Studied different designing pattern.</li>
<li>Developed the prototype for the landing page(roughly).</li>
<li>It would consist of the 4 slides</li>
<li>Customizing the header as it is less responsive.</li>
<li>The first slide will be symbolizing that OGV is 3D viewer and
    introductory part along with the login link to login page. Little
    confused, with the content what to add more such that user at the
    first look can identify that it is a 3D viewer.</li>
<li>Second page would depict the working of OGV.</li>
<li>Third page confused :-/. What to add?</li>
<li>Last slide would comprise the important features expressed in
    interactive manner.</li>
<li>Footer which contains links to BRL-CAD site / blog / updates etc.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="may-26">May 26</h2>
<ul>
<li>Where models were shown that was removed from the existing one,
    instead an icon is created in the header, clicking of which will
    take us to the models page.</li>
<li>Reason for doing this is such that on clicking of an icon (OGV) it
    takes us to the landing page and not models page.</li>
<li>Make few changes in routes.js according to their functionality.</li>
<li>Continuing with the creation of the landing page but facing bit
    problem. This problem is either due to something wrong in routes or
    CSS. Working on it.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="may-27">May 27</h2>
<ul>
<li>Problem rising in CSS has been resolved.</li>
<li>In the landing page, out of four one is complete fully. The page is
    almost resposive.</li>
<li>Started with the 2nd slide also, gathering stuff for that.</li>
<li>The page has been post to my github account, soon will be sending
    the PR.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="may-28">May 28</h2>
<ul>
<li>The second slide is also complete of the landing page.</li>
<li>The slide is fully responsive.</li>
<li>Gathering ideas and content for the third slide.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="may-29">May 29</h2>
<ul>
<li>Slide 1 is completed. And it is fully responsive.</li>
<li>Little enhancement needs to be done in all the pages and as the
    colour of the slide do not relate to each other so improvements are
    needed.</li>
<li>I have added the slide to my github repo. After completing with the
    third slide I would send a PR and will make the changes as per the
    reviews.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="may-30">May 30</h2>
<ul>
<li>Final slide along with footer is also done.</li>
<li>Modification have been made in colour combination. Not well
    satisfied. Exploring more for it.</li>
<li>First slide plus sub-part of first slide is also modified.</li>
<li>Almost responsive.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="may-31">May 31</h2>
<ul>
<li>Little change in color combination of landing-page.</li>
<li>Looking for the cause of invalid error messages that occurs during
    submit button.</li>
<li>Before, meteor accept only .jpg file for model image but now user
    can upload .jpg, .jpeg, .png file for his model that are shown in My
    Models tab.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="1-june">1 June</h2>
<ul>
<li>I completed the landing page and sent that for review but sean
    pointed out mistakes. The detail of which lies on the mailing list.</li>
<li>According to the reviews given I made the improvement and I got
    positive review from sean about that.</li>
<li>Now the most important thing of the concern is the license of the
    icons that are used in OGV. I'm looking for the other sites that
    provide the free icons so that no issues are there.</li>
<li>While uploading the images, when no image was selected it didn't
    give any kind of error. This could be done through either adding
    onValid function in file or passing message in throwError. And I
    used throwError method for that.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="2-june">2 June</h2>
<ul>
<li>Moving towards the second milestone which is to add the loader.</li>
<li>Studied the different packages to add the loader.</li>
<li>Facing problems so I am studying the code and trying to understand
    it.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="3-4-june">3-4 June</h2>
<p>These two days I couldn't work much as I am suffering from viral-fever
and doctor has strictly told for a bed rest. I concentrated on the
loader part. I have tried using Meteor n-progress package for adding the
progress bar. It worked but the progress bar is not synchronized with
the backend process, the progress bar shows it completed but the backend
process is still in progress. Also, I have posted the problem on Mailing
List and even Inderpreet is also trying to look for it. Also, I have
tried with the waitOn function but no success. Currently I am
scrutinizing FSCollection and trying with the similar progress examples
and will then apply a Loader. Hope to complete it the soon.</p>
<h2 id="5-june">5 June</h2>
<p>Today I again dealt with the loader but I'm quite disappointed with
myself as I'm unable to implement it till now. I looked for
circular-progress packages and "tomi:upload-server and
tomi:upload-jquery" package. The example of this is working but their is
problem in implementation as it uses it own "tomi:upload-server"
whenever I use it OGV stop responding due to conflict in the names of
the templates. Still working on it. Secondly, I made little improvement
in the landing to send the PR.</p>
<h2 id="6-june">6 June</h2>
<p>I worked on the error part that of the notification previously, during
saving if there is any error an empty box was shown with no alert
message this thing has been corrected and now the proper error message
is shown when the image is not uploaded correctly. Secondly, I have
tasted the uplaoder using cfs progress upload the progress bar is shown
but it immediately completed.</p>
<p><code>{{&gt; FS.UploadProgressBar bootstrap=true class='progress-bar-success progress-bar-striped active' showPercent=true}}</code></p>
<p>According to me, I think something needs to be done at the backend so as
to synchronize the process with the front-end. I have posted my
confusion and question on BRL-CAD devel-mailing list.</p>
<h2 id="7-june">7 June</h2>
<ul>
<li>Today I decided to include the feedback form in the landing page as
    shubham has almost completed the back-end part of the feedback form
    so I thought to complete from my side too.</li>
<li>I designed a wireframe for the feedback form and looked for the
    different ideas. to design the page.</li>
<li>I have tried my best to keep the page simple and informative.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="8-june">8 June</h2>
<ul>
<li>Shubham send the PR for the feedback form but I thought to have that
    this page to be included in the landing page rather than making the
    separate template for it.</li>
<li>I have also convinced shubham degrading this by telling him
    advantages and dis-advantages regarding this.</li>
<li>Both logged In / Out user are able to fill the feedback form.</li>
<li>I have designed my own icon for this purpose as there need not to be
    issue of copyright or license.</li>
<li>I faced little problem for sending the email but now this is solved.</li>
<li>The page is also responsive and I have also send the PR.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="9-june">9 June</h2>
<ul>
<li>Today I started with the basics of Three.js so as to work with
    issues like setting the zoom limit, camera position etc.</li>
<li>Also, I worked on my fourth miltestones i.e related to the error
    notifications. In many of the cases no error message or not a
    correct error message is shown. Like the uploading a image of the
    incorrect format didn't show any message but now the proper error
    message is shown. At some places there is still a problem,
    continuing with that.</li>
<li>Earlier the image of only .jpg format was uploaded but now .PNG and
    .JPEG are also the accepatable formats. This was not correctly done
    in the earlier commit, now it is corrected.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="10-june">10 June</h2>
<ul>
<li>Looking into error notification problem.</li>
<li>All the methods already exist but there is the problem in error
    handling procedure, that may be due the updated version of meteor.</li>
<li>I tried with the example of try-catch on updated version which
    successfully implemented, now working according to that.</li>
<li>Also another thing I worked upon is the camera perspective.
    Previously, the model on the first sight viewed too large, even
    without any zoom in and the preview being too large was not shown
    completely. Now the camera perspective is set and scene shows the
    model correctly.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="11-june">11 June</h2>
<ul>
<li>Simple notification replaced with sAlert notification. It adds to
    lot many features such that the success, warning etc messages
    remains for particular period of time. For e.g on clicking on the
    embed model the notification would last for about 10 sec, so that
    the user can copy it also. Similarly warning and error messages
    would last for 8 and 4 seconds respectively and so on.</li>
<li>Found bug in exception handling. Exception handling not working
    properly due to some missing parameter or due to improper coding.
    Because of this</li>
</ul>
<p><code>if(err) {</code>
<code>throwError(err.reason)</code>
<code>}</code></p>
<p>not working. Looking for the root of problem.</p>
<h2 id="12-june">12 June</h2>
<ul>
<li>Done with the setting of the zoom limit. Earlier the minimum
    distance was zero, and the maximum distance was infinity. But now
    the limits are set. The minimum distance I have kept is 20 and the
    maximum is 10000.</li>
<li>Camera position is also set now. Earlier at the first look the model
    shown was either much zoomed out or zoomed in that is camera
    position was not set properly. Now it is corrected.</li>
<li>Also, I tested different .g files, and found that it doesn't work
    correctly for larger file sizes. On uploading it, for smaller amount
    of time after rendering all went well but after that my laptop froze
    and there was either no or very slow cursor movement. I posted a
    mail regarding it, that how to overcome it.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="13-june">13 June</h2>
<ul>
<li>Merged new icons made by Inderpreet with mine icons.</li>
<li>Minor changes in landing page.</li>
<li>Added HTML5 validation on feedback form. Meteor validations pending
    will do ASAP.</li>
<li>Added error message if user upload file instead of .g or .obj.</li>
<li>Added different view functionality to view model from different
    angle on keyboard button press. F for front-view, R for rear view, T
    for top view and B for bottom view. It's working but there is a
    small glitch in it, after pressing any of these button I have to
    zoom out little bit to get perfect view :-/. Checked at lot but
    didn't find any perfect solution for it. Will solve this bug ASAP.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="14-15-june">14-15 June</h2>
<ul>
<li>Nothing much, little busy in college paper work.</li>
<li>Designing new icons for front-end page.</li>
<li>Worked on feedback form validations.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="16-june">16 June</h2>
<ul>
<li>Talked on three.js IRC regarding my onKeyDown button problem. They
    provide me solution to make changes on few places but bad luck
    nothing worked for me :-/. Looking something else for this problem.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="17-june">17 June</h2>
<ul>
<li>Made header part more responsive and did proper alignment according
    to different screen sizes.</li>
<li>I have tested the feedback page, there were little fluctuations so
    made them correct and now it's working fine.</li>
<li>Applied validations on feedback form input fields. Facing little
    problem in meteor validations.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="18-june">18 June</h2>
<ul>
<li>The views set previously were not working correctly as we need to
    zoom it or out a little to view. There were certain conflicts in the
    code and scene position was not correctly set, as I was using
    OrbitControls as well as controlling the camera directly. Glitches
    has been removed now and one can properly see all the views of the
    model.</li>
<li>To make it user friendly, by using the CSS I have designed an
    indicator / icon to the bottom left hand side of the model viewer
    page. This will, on hovering will indicate the user to switch to
    different views on pressing the respective keyboard keys.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="19-june">19 June</h2>
<ul>
<li>Went through work done till now. Find out minor bugs and resolved
    them.</li>
<li>Had a meeting with Sean. I showed my work done till now. Some of the
    mistakes and issues were indicated by him.</li>
<li>Started resolving the issues as said.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="20-june">20 June</h2>
<ul>
<li>Working on the issues.</li>
<li>Now when the user logs in, view model button is shown instead of
    sign-up button which was shown earlier on the landing page.</li>
<li>If someone navigates to the wrong / incorrect page 404 error is
    shown( Designing work is pending)</li>
<li>Little modification in routes after log-in.</li>
<li>Description is shown on the My-Models page to the new user (earlier
    it was empty).</li>
<li>Working on the validation part of feedback form.</li>
</ul>

</ul>
<p><code>if (.g to .obj conversion === true)</code>

<p>Meteor installation progress on freeBSD summary:</p>
<p>After facing errors it tried to install freeBSD on more time but with
different techniques. I went through various blogs / videos etc. but at
last no luck as I'm getting same error again and again. I took
approximately 3-4 hours. Then I planned to compile the source-code of
freeBSD 10.1. I took 5-6 hours to get compiled in virtual-box but I
faced new obstacle in my path that was the loss of internet
connectivity. Hush!.
Once again I tried to compile it from another tutorial, luckily this
time I successfully installed freeBSD 10.1. It's a new experience for me
to install OS from scratch. After installing freeBSD, I went through the
basic steps that were used to install on Ubuntu. And I faced the same
error which I feared of</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../../img/Meteor_freeBSD_error.png" /></p>
<p>As there is no official support for meteor on freeBSD. I searched more
on this and found on post which said that one should try first cloning
meteor from git and then in meteor file comment out the if condition
which generates that error</p>
<p><code>if [ "$UNAME" != "Linux" -a "$UNAME" != "Darwin" ] ; then</code>
<code>echo "Sorry, this OS is not supported."</code>
<code>exit 1</code>
<code>fi</code></p>
<p>This failed too. Now I'm trying to create build and then compile and
then install particular libraries and packages whatever etc needed. I
hope this will work it not sure but confident.</p>

<ul>
<li>Error regarding libm.so.6 has been solve.</li>
<li>Playing with bundle part of meteor on .bz server.</li>
<li>Tested bundle after installing lastest fibers but getting
    <strong><a href="https://paste.kde.org/pu5jky1ee/">this</a></strong> error. I searched and
    found this could be the soultion i.e downgrade node to 0.10.31 even
    something same is written on meteor offical docs.

<li>Build freebsd one more time from scratch. As I was facing hell lot
    of errors while installing meteor bundle on freebsd so I decided to
    go through from scratch one more time. After installing freebsd next
    step is to install nodejs but on official blog of meteor it is
    written that current meteor bundle is tested on version 0.10.36 of
    nodejs so after a long-long search on google finally I'm able to
    install nodejs v-0.10.36.</li>

<p>Meteor bundle / Meteor tested on mongo version 2.4.x, 2.6.x version is
not supported</p>
<p><code>Latest MongoDB supported by Meteor is MongoDB 2.4.x, the 2.6.x isn't supported yet by Meteor and Freebsd</code></p>
<p>Looking for the right way to install mongodb 2.4.x on freebsd.</p>
<h2 id="23-july">23 July</h2>
<p>Facing problem while installing mongodb 2.4.x. Tried to install it from
binaries even by changing ports configuration but no luck. Discuss this
problem on IRC. Going to install mongodb-2.6.x and check if it working
or not with node version-0.10.36.</p>
<h2 id="24-25-july">24-25 July</h2>
<p>After failing all test / tries on freeBSD an alternative is chosen i.e
Ubuntu Server 14.04 LTS virtual image. After installing and testing
ubuntu server in virtual box and end result was that, it passed all
test. I'm able to run OGV from host to guest. Next thing I'm working on
is to make this image more secure so that there will be no security
hacks.</p>
<h2 id="26-july">26 July</h2>
<p>Tested OGV links on Ubuntu Server in VM and removed minor bugs.</p>
<h2 id="27-july">27 July</h2>
<p>I discussed my problem with sean. He told me to upload the things on the
server and show the work. Size of .vdi file being to large around 3-4 GB
created a doubt in sean mind and he told me to debug the thing. Doing so
I experience some new commands which I have never heard before. After
getting the results of debugging I decided to do the things once again
and side by side to note the size of all the packages that would be
required to be installed.</p>
<h2 id="28-july">28 July</h2>
<p>Installing ubuntu server one more time from scratch.</p>
<h2 id="29-july">29 July</h2>
<p>Installation complete. I'll send the report about my progress to sean by
email.</p>
<h2 id="30-31-july">30-31 July</h2>
<p>After getting reviews on email from sean my next step is to solve the
problem of the files that reside in .meteor/local/db/ folder. Looking
into it.</p>
<h2 id="1-august">1 August</h2>
<p>Problem regarding db folder solved now the size of OGV folder is 25MB,
earlier which was 505MB. Next step is to run .vdi on the server.</p>
<h2 id="2-3-august">2-3 August</h2>
<p>For the purpose of testing I tried running .vdi file on the virtual
machine ( Virtual machine within virtual machine :D ) and the result was
that my system is dead :(. Currently I'm waiting it to recover fast.</p>
<h2 id="4-5-august">4-5 August</h2>
<p>Finally I got my laptop back. I tried one more time installing virtual
machine within virtual machine (this time with proper settings). I set
up an environment similar like .bz server and installed virtual box with
--headless settings. But I faced some problem, problem is like that,
that the virtual box has only 32bit of OS support not having 64bit
support. Looking 64bit problem's solutions.</p>
<h2 id="6-august">6 August</h2>
<p>Looking for the 64 bit problem as it is not compatible both with freeBSD
and Ubuntu Server virtual box. When I tried to create a new disk in
virtual-box only 32 bit options are shown.</p>
<h2 id="7-8-august">7-8 August</h2>
<p>I planned to download 32-bit Ubuntu Server 14.04 LTS iso. After
installing it, installed all the required requisites to run OGV and it
worked from guest to host. Now going to test previous concept, VM in VM.</p>
<h2 id="9-10-august">9-10 August</h2>
<p>In order to run from command line I installed following packages :
phpvirtualmanchine, apache2, php5 etc. so as to run virtual machine from
virtual, and upload .vdi file from the browser instead of running so
many command on terminal. Whenever I do so it executes upto GRUB and
after that blank screen appears. Working on it.</p>
<h2 id="11-12-august">11-12 August</h2>
<p>Tried to upload .vdi file, completed upto 700-800 MB but after that it
stops there. When I tried to do again neither scp nor ssh worked.
Discussed regarding this with Erik he told me to wait for a day.
Waiting... and looking for the solutions.</p>
<h2 id="13-august">13 August</h2>
<p>Meanwhile I get the solution for the above problem, I planned to solve
the merge conflicts and side by side worked on the front-end.</p>
<h2 id="14-august">14 August</h2>
<p>Problem still exists, posted mail regarding that on devel-mailing list.
Meanwhile, working on front-end part.</p>
<h2 id="15-august">15 August</h2>
<p>Solved problem regarding merge conflicts. PR's has been send. Now
working on UI part of back-end work and refactoring and debugging code.</p>
<h2 id="16-august">16 August</h2>
<p>Approximately 70-80% of work regarding UI problem, responsiveness,
duplicate tabs / code, refactoring code etc. has been solved and PR's
sent. One PR accepted waiting for the rest to get merged asap.</p>
<h2 id="17-august">17 August</h2>
<p>Everything regarding front-end part almost done just left with minor
things which first need to discuss with Shubham so that I can take
action on it and move further.</p>
<h2 id="18-19-august">18-19 August</h2>
<p>I'm back to the server problem. I found vagrant tool and tried to make
.vdi up through that. Vagrant got installed in couple of seconds and now
I'm testing the things. Going to test on the server.</p>
<h2 id="20-august">20 August</h2>
<p>I got the ssh/scp problem resolved by Erik with his permission I got
vagrant installed to. Playing with it, error encountered. Asked for the
error on the IRC waiting for the reply.</p>
<h2 id="21-august">21 August</h2>
<p>Shared the problem with sean, he provided with the solution that to use
command line to up .iso file. It has been successfully done but now
after running this --headless command I just want some sort of
connection between the remote and local machine to see it's GUI and all
the process. Working on it.</p></div>
