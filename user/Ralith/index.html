<h5 id="2009-07-09">2009-07-09</h5>

    appears to have had no effect upon the Ogre/Qt conflict.</li>
<li>Found and successfully tested QCoreApplication::processEvents, which
    appears Qt to function with an external mainloop, significantly
    simplifying the matter of putting Qt under Ogre's control.</li>
<li>Made a first attempt at the as-yet-untested QtRenderListener, which
    is intended to allow Qt to do everything it needs to, including
    rendering its widgets to the shared OpenGL context, without being
    interfered with by Ogre. It tries to achieve this by explicitly
    stepping Qt after the completion of an Ogre render queue, and within
    a prepared OpenGL state.</li>
<li>Began reworking ogretest.cxx to allow the QtRenderListener to be

<h5 id="2009-07-10">2009-07-10</h5>
<ul>
<li>Completed and began debugging test code for operating Qt on Ogre's
    terms. Widgets are not yet rendered correctly, but there is some
    evidence that adjustments to this approach, perhaps in the details
    of resetting OpenGL state in QtRenderListener::renderQueueEnded,
    still have potential. Initial attempts resulted in a black window
    with the dark grey of the configured Ogre background color present
    in a rectangle in the lower left corner. Disabling Ogre buffer swap
    (as Qt almost certainly performs its own bufferswap when stepped,
    although I'm not at all certain swapping buffers at the point at
    which Qt is stepped (which is much earlier than when Ogre normally
    swaps buffers, although it ostensibly occurs at the end of the
    render queue, of whose significance I am uncertain) is safe in Ogre,
    particularly considering that OpenGL state is
    saved/restored/otherwise twiddled across the swap) replaced this
    rectangle with one of white, the color which Qt draws as a
    background to its widgets by default. If this is in fact the source
    of the white, then it may be that getting that rectangle realigned
    with (i.e. filling) the context will result in visible
    widgets—although then the opaque white background will need to be
    removed.</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="2009-07-11">2009-07-11</h5>
<ul>
<li>Experimented with disabling portions of the OpenGL state reset in
    QtRenderListener to solve presumed alignment issues, identifying
    interesting effects observed yesterday as unrelated to Qt.</li>
<li>Observed the alignment issue dissapear and reappear across multiple
    runs of an unmodified test binary. Perhaps this is some side effect
    of an absence of special handling for the resizes enforced by my
    (tiling) window manager?</li>
<li>Attempted to contact the author of the Ogre native render system
    code on which the current effort is founded for advice and further
    information.</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="2008-07-12">2008-07-12</h5>
<ul>
<li>Original native render system author had nothing to offer. Started
    <a href="http://www.ogre3d.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=2&amp;t=51199">a new
    thread</a> on
    the Ogre forums with more detailed information in the hopes of
    hooking in someone more knowledgable.</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="2008-07-14">2008-07-14</h5>
<ul>
<li>In light of the incredible resistance of the Ogre/Qt conflict to
    solution, I discussed alternatives with mentors and decided to
    attempt rendering Qt atop, rather than into, Ogre's heavily defended
    context.<ul>
<li>First attempt used a QDialog for testing. No luck until a call
    to QDialog::show() is applied to the QDialog, which leads to
    apparent initial success tempered by the realization that the
    QDialog is being rendered as, surprisingly, a popup dialog—that
    is, a separate top-level window. It turns out this is documented
    behavior; I must assume that its use in the model renderer
    example from the Qt blog using the GraphicsView system is an
    exception to this rule. Thus, previous experiments' use of it
    was likely not invalid.</li>
<li>Second attempt used a simpler widget, the QPushButton. Again no
    initial results, but the removal of code giving the OgreGLWidget
    an initial size of 1024x768 on a hunch that it was leading to
    some form of subtle conflict with my window manager lead to the
    widget becoming visible within the OgreGLContext as desired.
    Thus, this attempt was a success.<ul>
<li>Further experimentation showed that a call to
    QPushButton::show(), in this case left over from the
    symbol's original role as a QDialog, was necessary for it to
    appear, although I don't recall seeing such calls in the
    original model renderer (quite possibly they were hidden
    elsewhere; it had quite a bit of widget initialization
    code). Earlier failed attempts to get Ogre and Qt to
    cooperate will bear repetition with this call added, as
    ideal results may still be attainable through its use.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="2008-07-17">2008-07-17</h5>
<ul>
<li>Verified support for more advanced Qt functionality within
    OgreGLWidget</li>
<li>Successfully integrated support for Qt Designer's output files into
    the build system</li>
<li>Using Qt Designer, assembled a simple GUI based on the original G3D
    GUI as designed by mafm</li>
<li>Wrapped Qt Designer output to allow functionality to be attached to
    GUI signals</li>
<li>Created a new "Console" widget that includes an auto-hiding output
    window, and successfully used Qt Designer to place it in the GUI</li>
<li>Added timer code to ensure that the OgreGLWidget is redrawn
    frequently</li>
<li>Encountered a heisenbug in which garbage is scribbled all over areas
    of the GUI intended to be transparent; I conjecture that this
    relates to the drawing of Qt widgets on top of, rather than into,
    the OpenGL context, and that drawing Qt directly into the
    OgreGLWidget would resolve the issue.</li>
<li>Tweaked the GUI layout to make aforementioned bug unobtrusive when
    it manifests to allow an attractive and usable GUI to be implemented
    without relying upon a fix for the bug manifesting in short order.</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="2009-08-03">2009-08-03</h5>
<p>Much has happened since last log. In summary, OpenGL embedding is now
functional, and after some work the GUI has been restored to original
G3D functionality and can be seen following.

<h4 id="abstract">Abstract</h4>
<p>I propose to continue the development of the OpenGL Geometry Editor GUI
effort began during Summer of Code 2008 through modifying the existing
application to take advantage of the Qt application and UI framework and
then taking advantage of the wide array of development tools, widgets,
and libraries offered by the framework to rapidly flesh out the front
end, with the ultimate goal of preparing a powerful and intuitive CSG
modeling GUI ready for connection to the geometry service.</p>
<h4 id="content">Content</h4>
<p>BRL-CAD is unparalleled in power and maturity in the small world of
open-source CAD, and has a feature-set capable of competing successfully
with commercial CAD products. However, the suite has until recently, as
an in-house tool, been targeted almost exclusively at small population
of trained experts. As such, the current standard modeler, mged, is
highly unintuitive, requiring extensive perusal of documentation before
even relatively straightforward modeling tasks can be completed
reliably. To make BRL-CAD a useful and attractive toolset for a wider
audience, it is therefore critical to implement a more intuitive GUI
without sacrificing the power offered by mged.</p>
<p>As a well-recognized need, this project was first addressed in a <a href="OpenGL_GUI_Framework#Initial_Project_from_GSoC_2008.md">2008
Summer of Code
project</a>
which produced the beginnings of a working prototype based upon
<a href="http://www.ogre3d.org/">Ogre</a> and
<a href="http://www.rightbraingames.com/tech/">RBGui</a>. While it provides an
attractive beginning, it lacks any actual editing interface, and suffers
from limited potential for direct growth as a result of the selection of
RBGui, which is unmaintained (to the extent that I found it unbuildable
on Linux without numerous modifications), has a limited selection of
widgets, has no design tools or other development aids, and lacks much
of the higher-level functionality that can be found elsewhere. To remedy
this, I propose to within the existing codebase swap out RBGui with
<a href="http://www.qtsoftware.com/">Qt</a>, an extremely
<a href="http://doc.trolltech.com/4.5/examples.html">powerful</a>,
<a href="http://doc.trolltech.com/4.5/index.html">well-documented</a>, and
<a href="http://www.qtsoftware.com/qt-in-use">widely-used</a> application and UI
framework, and is well supported on <a href="http://doc.trolltech.com/4.5/supported-platforms.html">all remotely popular
platforms</a>, and
popular itself to the extent that up to date binaries for it exist in
most package management systems, offsetting the admitted problem
presented by the notoriously slow build process of the framework.
Additionally, a wide variety of <a href="http://www.qtsoftware.com/products/developer-tools">development
tools</a> exist, which
have the potential to accelerate prototyping immensely compared to the
hand-coded measures necessary in the current implementation. Although Qt
is traditionally rendered in software, making it seem an odd choice for
use within an OpenGL context as RBGui is currently used, Qt recently
gained <a href="http://doc.trolltech.com/4.5/demos-boxes.html">support</a> for this
type of use.</p>
<p>Once I have successfully integrated Qt with Ogre and substituted it for
all uses of RBGui, I will work to continue the efforts made last year to
develop it into a complete geometry editor frontend based upon the
<a href="http://brlcad.org/design/gui/">Ideal Operating Environment</a> concept
around which the work up to this point has been based. In particular, I
will work to construct a framework for the rapid prototyping of a highly
usable GUI composed of actions accessible through multiple routes,
including the command line and multiple GUI methods, and leveraging it
to form an interface with functions to perform and display a variety of
common basic editing operations. Support for actually performing these
operations will be implemented through stubs wrapping libged
functionality, to be replaced with use of the geometry service as soon
as it is practical. This will allow a degree of actual functionality
sufficient to test the GUI design in practice, allowing for meaningful
early analysis of the effectiveness of design decisions, which will
support the direct evolution of the interface towards the greatest
possible usability. Although the scope of functionality to be
implemented will be inevitably limited by the time allowed for the
Summer of Code, I hope to continue on with this project after the
Summer's completion, as I believe strongly in the importance of such an
interface to BRL-CAD's success, and the benefits such success has to
offer to a diverse audience; as the sole example of high-quality open
CAD software, bringing an accessible BRL-CAD into reality would not only
benefit current users of such technology, but help make CAD accessible
to those unable to afford the expensive licenses typically required for
commercial options, potentially opening up a whole new world of open
community-oriented design projects, paralleling with real-world products
the massive success of open software.</p>
<p>To achieve these goals I will take advantage of my existing familiarity
with both the BRL-CAD internals and the modeling interface (and power
thereof) offered by mged, as well as experience with the popular
<a href="http://www.blender.org/">Blender</a> modeling and 3D graphics toolkit, the
familiarity with C, C++, and many similar languages I've developed
through years of self-motivated programming, and the familiarity with
build systems, command line interaction paradigms, and diverse user
interface designs conferred by regular use of Unix-based systems for
both software development and everday tasks. Additionally, I will take
advantage of my familiarity with the community, a result of my presence
on IRC for most of the past year under the nick "Ralith," to engage with
the current primary users of BRL-CAD for immediate feedback on my
prototypes, in the interest of creating a tool that is not only
attractive to new users, but powerful and intuitive to long-time users
of the system as well.</p>
