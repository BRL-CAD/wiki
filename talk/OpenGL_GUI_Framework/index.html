<h3 id="about-project-plan">About project plan</h3>
<p>Sean</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Since this project involves integrating with a back-end, one that is
also being developed in parallel and does not yet exist, you'll either
need to be able to stub back-end functionality as needed, or actually
plan to contribute to the back-end and associated protocol as part of
your development. Either approach would understandably affect your
progress, but it's something to keep in mind with regards to the
timeline and expectations.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="about-gui">About GUI</h3>
<p>Sean</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I'd like to hear your thoughts on how you'd go about providing a
console and other GUI widget elements. Did you have a toolkit in mind?
The options are notably limited for opengl applications (particularly
for providing complex interfaces) and can be decided upon later, but
I'd like to hear your thoughts. The design can of course be abstracted
so that the actual widget layer doesn't matter so much (similar to how
the graphics engine could be abstracted so OGRE could be replaced if
desired), but there are other bigger considerations like whether the
interface is zoomable/scalable or fixed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Manuel</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I already used CEGUI with CrystalSpace [and OpenSceneGraph] and it's
originally from OGRE, so I guess that it's the most straightforward
option.</p>
<p>In CEGUI you can define the interface with XML files so it's often
easier to test than having to recompile for every change. The units in
principle are scalable, so you define the height and width of the
widgets relative to the screen size (maybe in newer versions some of
this changed, but there's only one stable release since I was using
it). Is there a priori any preference about this, or goals that the
widget system should absolutely meet? I think that most of the widget
libraries for OpenGL are quite limited, as you say.</p>
<p>And for OGRE there's the following quote about GUIs: "MyGui joins the
ranks of GUI systems available for OGRE, in addition to CEGui,
BetaGUI, QuickGUI, RBGui and OpenGUI" from
<a href="http://www.ogre3d.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=449&amp;Itemid=2">http://www.ogre3d.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=449&amp;Itemid=2</a>
(I couldn't find a more comprehensive list with explanations).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sean</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We'd of course probably want something considerably more
polished/clean than the rather gamey default interface seen in the
CEGUI screenshots. If I recall correctly, the last time I spoke with
the CEGUI developers they indicated that while you can "scale" the
interface, the effect is the same as scaling a raster image. So the
application has to manage "native" sizes to minimize scaling
artifacts. It didn't support scalable vector graphics instead of
rather imagery. Something we can probably live with, but it "would
really be nice".</p>
<p>Would also be useful if you could verify which of the available
toolkit options you mention are suitable and describing the various
tradeoffs. That is, presuming CEGUI isn't already known to be the best
option available. If it is, then it sounds like a workable plan I
could go with myself (other mentors feel free to chime in if
otherwise).</p>
<p>Another thing to keep in mind for the context itself, multiple display
support should be inherent with respect to the apps ability to go
fullscreen (across multiple displays or single display) or windowed.
CAD apps are usually heavily limited by screen real-estate.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Manuel</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I was checking CEGUI and it seems that they don't have new
functionalities in 0.6.0 (released a couple of weeks ago) that could
overcome the problems that you say (supporting vectorized formats or
so), and I read some threads in the forums about that being unlikely.</p>
<p>About the rest, first impressions:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>MyGUI: Lack of pages describing features, only Doxygen
documentation... Some screenshots:
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/screenshots.php?group_id=193706">http://sourceforge.net/project/screenshots.php?group_id=193706</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>BetaGUI: Too basic, only intended for quick demos and only for OGRE.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>QuickGUI: It's a mix between BetaGUI and CEGUI and with the same
limitations, also only for OGRE. From the author: "Under the hood
everything is implemented in pixels, but the user works in Relative
coordinates. [...]. "As far as sizing, I don't know how I would
implement that functionality. Looking at windows on XP for example,
you can resize the MyComputer window, and the icons will move around,
and add scroll bars, etc. I think at the moment that is too advanced
for what I want to accomplish. I do plan to support scaling of
windows, similar to WoW, where everything in the window gets bigger,
so you can shrink/blow it up easily to match your preference".</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>RBGui: I didn't find much info (features list and the like) except
for a longish thread of about 30 pages in OGRE forums. The video of
the GUI editor is nice, though: <a href="http://rightbraingames.com/Gui.wmv">http://rightbraingames.com/Gui.wmv</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>OpenGUI: Same lack of pages describing features, and it seems very
old and simple:
<a href="http://opengui.rightbracket.com/component/option,com_gallery2/Itemid,49/">http://opengui.rightbracket.com/component/option,com_gallery2/Itemid,49/</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>GUIchan: While looking at this I also found this one. List of
features: <a href="http://guichan.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/Features">http://guichan.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/Features</a>
which doesn't give much information about that (but you can also see
some screenshots in that website, and it doesn't seem especially
advanced).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Another one that I found, Navi, the capabilities look amazing and it
seems the more powerful of all, with all the capabilities of Mozilla
browsers:
<a href="http://navi.agelessanime.com/wiki/index.php/NaviLibrary_Overview">http://navi.agelessanime.com/wiki/index.php/NaviLibrary_Overview</a></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>So having a look at this, I can only see Navi and RBGui as potentially
better than CEGUI.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sean</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Thanks for the summary impressions of the various toolkits. I didn't
think that there really was any "better" option than CEGUI, I'm
probably most just complaining that there's not a great option.. :-)</p>
<p>Navi is very impressive indeed, but the LLMozLib that it depends on
(UBrowser) is Windows-only right now. As that is a fundamentally
different way to provide the GUI (i.e. via HTML), you'd have to talk
to research or talk to the devs to see how much effort porting to
other platforms would take (is it just a simple matter of wrapping
other native gl interfaces?) since portability to at least Linux, BSD,
and MacOSX would be required down the road. Also, it would be good to
know what the external dependencies are. The best aspect of the
approach, though, is that you can end up with fixed resolution or
resolution-independent displays.</p>
<p>The same mostly goes for RBGUI too .. it's a *very* impressive demo
video and looks like it might even be reasonably extensible, but it's
also presently only available for Windows. If selected, this one
definitely deserves investigating how much effort porting would
actually take and how well it could support a scalable interface.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Manuel</p>
<blockquote>
<p>About porting those, Navi maybe it's complicate, but it doesn't seem
that getting RBGui to work in Unices is much of a problem:
<a href="http://shiware.com/media/">http://shiware.com/media/</a> (look at the
<a href="http://shiware.com/media/rbgui-linux.png">http://shiware.com/media/rbgui-linux.png</a> and
<a href="http://shiware.com/media/RBGui010linux.diff">http://shiware.com/media/RBGui010linux.diff</a> especially), unless they
are requiring much more system-dependent functions now than in middle
of July 2007 (the date of the files in the server). There's even
<a href="http://rpm.pbone.net/index.php3/stat/4/idpl/6224695/com/rbggui-devel-0.1.3-14.15.i586.rpm.html">http://rpm.pbone.net/index.php3/stat/4/idpl/6224695/com/rbggui-devel-0.1.3-14.15.i586.rpm.html</a>
from March 2008... :)</p>
<p>If it's not difficult to get it working, I would initially try to use
it instead of CEGUI, starting to test before the official coding
starts -- resorting to CEGUI is always possible, but since we already
know what it can offer (and it's not that much) it would be preferable
to exhaust other options first.</p>
