<h4 id="google-code-in-2014">Google Code In 2014</h4>
<p>Out of only 12 selected, we're very proud to announce that BRL-CAD is
participating in the 2014 Google Code-In (GCI) program! Complementary to
the highly successful Google Summer of Code program for university
students, GCI is a contest to encourage pre-university students (age
13-17) to get involved with open source.This is the third consecutive
year, BRLCAD is accepted as a mentoring organization.</p>

<h4 id="geometry-viewer">Geometry Viewer</h4>
<p>Geometry Viewer-</p>
<p><b>What is a geometry viewer?</b></p>
<p>It’s a service which allows users to manage all there geometry files. It
can upload and view BRL-CAD geometry files in a different format so that
others can edit it. But it’s currently under construction.</p>
<p><b>It’s the equivalent to?</b></p>
<p>It’s like a Facebook for files where you can share other files with the
public and then they can edit, change or fix the application to make it
smother.</p>
<p><b>Why is it used?</b></p>
<p>It’s used to allow the user to become more organised and make the user
interface easier to follow and understand.</p>
<p><b>What is needed to access this service?</b></p>
<p>All you need on your computer with a Web GL supported browser, BRL-CAD,
three.js and a Linux Apache MySQL PHP (LAMP).</p>
<p><b>How it works?</b></p>
<p>Using BRL-CAD it changes the format to OBJ and loads it through the
three.js all in all it converts then loads.</p>
<p><b>Advantages</b></p>
<p>•Easier for the user to manage</p>
<p>•Allows all user to see the file as it converts the format</p>
<p>•Makes sharing easier and safer due to the fact you still have overall
control</p>
<p>•It allows the skills of strangers to improve your application safely</p>
<p>•Its currently under construction so more features will be add</p>

<p>Do you enjoy correcting faults?</p>
<p>Would you like to make improvements to software that vast numbers of
users will benefit from?</p>
<p>Would you like to enhance your resume and gain wider experience? Do you
have some spare time?</p>
<p>We need a software maintainer/release maintainer. Maintainers are needed
for free and open source software to perform a variety of tasks. As
BRL-CAD is a cross-platform system it has maintainers allocated to many
binary platforms but does not currently have one for Windows. We are
looking for someone to fill this voluntary role which is critical when
releasing software.</p>
<p>A maintainer is someone who is basically willing to support creating the
release for a particular platform (In this case Windows). Typical
responsibilities include building source code into a binary package,
patching and investigating platform issues, naming and announcing a
release.</p>

<h4 id="google-code-in-2013-updates">Google Code In 2013 Updates</h4>
<p>The Google Code-in is a contest to introduce pre-university students
(ages 13-17) to the many kinds of contributions that make open source
software development possible. This is the second consecutive year when
the esteemed open source solid modeling tool, BRL-CAD is accepted to
participate in Google Code-In, out of the total of 10 organizations
chosen.</p>
<p>Many of you would be wondering about the participation of BRL-CAD in GCI
so far and hence, I came up with this post. The contest runs from
November 18, 2013 to January 6, 2014. Its December,15 today, where we
are exactly half-way on the journey. This year BRL-CAD has received an
over-whelming response from young smart talented kids from all around
the world, where they are contributing to small itty-bitty tasks of not
more than 72 hours based in various domains related to software
development and maintenance like Coding, Documentation and Training,
Quality Assurance, User Interface and Outreach and Research.</p>
<p>After many task claims, reclaims, rejection, improvements, exchange of
ideas and views between students and mentors via comments, IRC and
mailing list and then acceptance of each task, till date, 87 tasks with
minutely observed perfection have been closed successfully. 3 tasks are
with status 'Needs Work', which means one of the mentors has sent back
those tasks for more work. 4 tasks are on the to-be-reviewed list of
mentors, 7 tasks currently claimed and 21 tasks are reopened and 85
tasks open with a total of 207 tasks.</p>
<p>I hope the young brains are enjoying while they work on the kinds of
tasks they are comfortable. It is not just about working on tasks, it
means much more than that. I bet, being a part of an awesome, cool and
one of the most friendly open source organizations and working in
collaboration with fantastic perks all across the planet Earth at such a
small age will be an astronomical experience for participants.</p>
<p>A huge thanks to all participants for making it a huge and happening
contest. Thanks to all mentors for adding tasks time-to-time to meet the
demand and supply curve of fresh new tasks. Special thanks to Sean, the
man without whom BRL-CAD's participation in GCI is hard to imagine. All
the best kids for rest of the contest. A ticket to Google’s Mountain
View, California, USA Headquarters is awaiting for two grand-prize
winners. Good Luck ! :)</p>
<h4 id="gci-2013-quick-update-highlights-2">GCI 2013 Quick Update/ Highlights (2)</h4>
<p>With 12 days, 2 hours remaining for the task to end, i.e. 33% of the
contest still remaining, we have got pretty amazing statistics until
now.</p>
<p>After many task claims, reclaims, rejection, improvements, exchange of
ideas and views between students and mentors via comments, IRC and
mailing list and then acceptance of each task, till date, 162 tasks with
minutely observed perfection have been closed successfully. 7 tasks are
with status 'Needs Work', which means one of the mentors has sent back
those tasks for more work. 2 tasks are on the to-be-reviewed list of
mentors, 4 tasks currently claimed and 73 tasks open with a total of 247
tasks.</p>
<p>We have already crossed 25% more than that of the last year's record.
Let wait and watch how far can we go and break our own records.</p>
<p>Good luck Kids !</p>

<h4 id="improving-brl-cads-networking-libraryandrei-constantin-popescu">"Improving BRL-CAD's networking library":Andrei - Constantin Popescu</h4>
<p>by: Plamen Nikiforov</p>
<p>Andrei - Constantin Popescu is a second year undergraduate at
Polytechnic University of Bucharest, studying at the computer science
department. Here is an interview about Andreis Google Summer of Code
project. Plamen(Pl): How did you found out about BRL-CAD and why did you
chose to them?</p>
<p>Andrei(An): I heard about BRL-CAD when I was searching for a Google
Summer of Code project to do. After doing some research on their website
regarding Google Summer of Code ideas, several interested me
particularly. The language I am currently strongest in is C and I am
also interested in computer graphics, this motivated me towards applying
for BRL-CAD. Another key aspect was that the BRL-CAD mentoring community
was very friendly and helpful towards me.</p>
<p>Pl: Why did you choose "Improving BRL-CAD's networking library" to be
your project?</p>
<p>An: The first project idea I proposed was " Code reduction". First, I
looked at this project at Sean's suggestion. There were several reasons
why I chose this project idea : I was taking a networking course and it
would help me consolidate my knowledge and the performance testing
seemed a more interesting problem to investigate.</p>
<p>Pl: What were your aims of the project?</p>
<p>An: My initial aims were to investigate and fix any performance
bottleneck regarding transfer speed for various file sizes and package
sizes, test the code integrity of networking library and eliminating as
many unhandled exceptions as well as eliminating global variables from
the networking library.</p>
<p>“Here are some of Andreis performance measurements for different package
sizes: Package size 1 – 2048 - <a href="http://i.imgur.com/OPum5.png">http://i.imgur.com/OPum5.png</a> Package
size 2048 – 4194304 - <a href="http://i.imgur.com/fH4rL.png">http://i.imgur.com/fH4rL.png</a> Package size 1 –
4194304 - <a href="http://i.imgur.com/AXUpN.png">http://i.imgur.com/AXUpN.png</a> ”</p>
<p>Pl: Has this project helped your skills improve?</p>
<p>An: Definetly! The most important aspect is that I greatly improved my
communication skills. Aside of that, I also improved my capacity to work
in a team, developed the ability to work with a large code base and of
course improved my implementation skills.</p>
<p>Pl: Would you continue to contribute to BRL-CAD? An: Of course ! I
continued to contribute even after Google Summer of Code. Even if my
contributions aren't as numerous as I would like because of my crowded
academic schedule, I am trying t</p>
<h2 id="initial-drafts">Initial Drafts</h2>
<p>These are incomplete articles being worked on. Short 250 to 500-word
articles (not counting tables, images, etc) are usually perfect.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="/wiki/img/BRL-CAD_Primitives_Chart.png" /></p>
<h4 id="mitchell-roberts-chart-of-all-primitives">Mitchell Roberts: Chart of all Primitives</h4>
<p>BRL-CAD supports 37 geometric primitive solids. A database containing
one example of each created and arranged into a chart. Each colored
rectangle in the background corresponds to a different type of primitive
(ex: the red group contains cones and cylinders). Primitives that fall
under multiple categories, like the pipe (made of cylinders and toroids)
are contained by multiple background rectangles. The ars and bot
examples did not raytrace correctly, but are continuing to be worked on.</p>
<p>The database can be used not only for a demonstration of BRL-CAD's
primitives and their unique uses, but also for regression testing.
Outputs from raytracing functions like rtWeight and rtArea can be
compared to established normals to ensure changes to the source code do
not cause unwanted changes to the way any primitives are raytraced. In
the future, a tool to create the database automatically will hopefully
be created and added to BRL-CAD's regression testing suite.</p>
<h4 id="physics-simulation-system">Physics Simulation System</h4>
<p>BRL-CAD includes a Bullet-based rigid-body physics simulation system.
The system takes advantage of BRL-CAD's ray tracing API to detect
collisions between arbitrarily-shaped geometry, which are then passed to
Bullet for physics calculations. The current system consists of a
working demo allowing one object to be subjected to gravity and then
collide with a fixed "ground" object.</p>
<p>Recently, the physics system has received some attention as BRL-CAD
works towards support for geometric constraints and joint systems. The
goal is to expand the demo into a useful physics system capable of
real-time simulation displayable in the Archer interface. In addition to
various bug fixes and performance improvements, changes that will be
merged soon include a flexible way for users to define simulation scenes
using BRL-CAD's attribute system along with a simple combination-based
scene description.</p>
<p>A video of the improved simulation system can be viewed at
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzaKWzntnmc">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzaKWzntnmc</a></p>
<h4 id="documentation-redux">Documentation Redux</h4>
<p>BRL-CAD was selected to participate in the 2013 Google Summer of Code
<strong><a href="http://www.flossmanuals.org/news/2013-doc-camp-call-proposals">Doc
Camp</a></strong>.
A team of contributors got together in California, brainstormed, and
wrote an entire book for BRL-CAD in just a few days. They created a
guide for contributing to BRL-CAD.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="/wiki/img/DocCamp_WorkingHard.jpg" /></p>
<p>Contrary to and perhaps because of longstanding efforts, people
interested in improving BRL-CAD sometimes find themselves lost in a sea
of information. In all, BRL-CAD has more than a million words of
documentation across hundreds of manual pages, dozens of tutorials and
examples, hundreds of wiki pages, dozens of technical papers, and other
resources. It's a lot, created over decades of development.</p>
<p>Over the course of a week in October, members from our community
participated in something fresh. Something different.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="/wiki/img/DocCamp_TopicWall.jpg" /></p>
<p>A team of individuals traveled to the Google headquarters in Mountain
View, California, to participate in a 2-part event: an unconference and
a book sprint. Teams for GNOME, OpenMRS, and BRL-CAD arrived on the
Google campus and talked about techniques, tools, formats, documenters,
and more. By the end of the week, seven individuals from four different
countries, three continents, and one oceanic island produced a book for
BRL-CAD more than 100 pages in length.</p>
<p>As free open source software, one of BRL-CAD's greatest strengths is
that anyone can get involved and directly contribute. You can make it
better. This new book focuses on that aspect and introduces people to
the project while providing detailed information for developers,
writers, artists, and other potential contributors.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="/wiki/img/DocCamp_Relaxing.jpg" /></p>
<p>This new effort kick-starts a campaign to dramatically improve BRL-CAD's
documentation, starting with this new contributor's guide.</p>
<p>Attending the camp provided an exciting opportunity to get a grasp on
new techniques for documenting and sharing information about our
software, hopefully in ways that help us grow our community. BRL-CAD's
team included Sean Morrison, Eric Edwards, Cliff Yapp, Harmanpreet
Singh, Check Nyah, Isaac Kamga, and Scott Nesbitt. Thank you to Google
for their sponsorship, <a href="http://aspirationtech.org/">Aspiration</a> for
magnificently framing the event, and <a href="http://www.flossmanuals.org/">FLOSS

<h4 id="anurag-murty-voxelizing-geometry">Anurag Murty: Voxelizing Geometry</h4>
<p>Given a set of primitives as input, the voxelize command uses the data
obtained from BRL-CAD's raytracer to represent the input in the form of
voxels(Volumetric Picture Elements). A uniform grid of rays is uniformly
shot on the given input and an approximation of the volume filled in
each voxel region is made from the raytracing data. Depending on the
approximate volume of the voxel filled, a voxel is classified as IN or
OUT of the voxelized output. The voxels are represented as RPPs. Such
voxelized outputs have applications in Volumetric rendering and finite
element analysis.</p>
<p>SYNTAX : voxelize [-s "dx dy dz"] [-d n] [-t f] new_obj old_obj
[old_obj2 old_obj3 ...]</p>
<p>ARGUMENTS-</p>
<p>-d - Specifies the level of detail(precision in approximation of volume)
required. An input of n means that n * n rays will be shot through each
row, and an approximation of volume filled is reached averaging these n
* n values</p>
<p>-s - Specifies the voxel size in each direction.</p>
<p>-t - Specifies the threshold volume to decide if voxel is to be included
in the voxelized output.</p>
<p>new_obj - Name for resultant primitive that is a region containing the
resulting voxels.</p>
<p>old_obj - Name of source primitive or collection.</p>
<p>NOTES-</p>
<p>1. A greater level of detail usually implies a much better
approximation of fill volumes at the cost of more computations.</p>
<p>2. Lesser voxel sizes give a more precise representation of the input
at the cost of more memory requirements.</p>
<p>3. Threshold value (the argument of -t) should be a value between 0 and
1, and not a percentage.</p>
<h4 id="cristina-precup-visualizing-directed-acyclic-graphs">Cristina Precup: Visualizing Directed Acyclic Graphs</h4>
<p><strong>Visualizing Constructive Solid Geometry</strong> is a project meant to
illustrate in an intuitive and interactive manner the hierarchical
structure of .g geometry databases.</p>
<p>For the representation of the hierarchies, the <strong>Adaptagrams</strong> graph
library has been used. This made possible organizing the objects
contained within the database into directed acyclic graphs.</p>
<p>Following, are the steps that have been taken in developing the graph
layout API:</p>
<ul>
<li>Integrate the Adaptagrams library into BRL-CAD.</li>
<li>Traverse the geometry database and distinguish different types of
    objects (<em>primitive</em>, <em>combination</em>, <em>non-geometry</em>) within it, as
    well as, establish the operations between them (<em>union</em>,
    <em>difference</em>, ...). Add all this data to the graph structure
    constructed with Adaptagrams.</li>
<li>Display the objects using a Tk Canvas widget inside a window.</li>
<li>Develop a <em>decorative routine</em> that sets different colors for
    different types of objects, correspondingly.</li>
<li>Create a name label for each represented object.</li>
<li>Develop a layout algorithm that aligns the nodes of the graph in a
    hierarchical way.</li>
<li>Introduce the <strong>graph</strong> command in both <strong>MGED</strong> and <strong>Archer</strong>. It
    has two subcommands:<ul>
<li><strong>show</strong> which displays a list with the name and type of the
    objects along with the nodes' and edges' positions;</li>
<li><strong>positions</strong> that lists the names, types and positions of the
    corresponding nodes within the graph;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Introduce the <strong>igraph</strong> command in both MGED and Archer. This
    command pops up a graph based visualization window of the currently
    opened .g database. Its documentation can be found in <em>brlman</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p>As an example, here is how the graph for the <em>share/db/axis.g</em> database
looks like now:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="/wiki/img/Graph_editor_v2.png" /></p>
<p>Further work that can extend the <em>interactive</em> trait of the graph layout
API includes adding user actions upon the graph such as <em>move</em> (dragging
a node) or <em>delete</em> functionalities.</p>

<p>The main idea is to store the data both in the database and the log
files stored in the archive. The storage in the database enables the
content to be searched via the parameters such as machine descriptions,
versions, results and could be compared. The storage as a file in the
archive is to maintain a back up of the file and whenever a developer
needs a specific bunch of benchmark logs, he could get them from the

<h4 id="wu-jianbang-nurbs-surface-surface-intersections">Wu Jianbang: NURBS surface-surface intersections</h4>
<p>I focused on the "NURBS surface-surface intersections" project after the
mid-term evaluation of this year's GSoC, before which I worked on
converting implicit primitives to NURBS B-rep forms.</p>
<p>The function calculating NURBS surface-surface intersection curves is
surface_surface_intersection() which is declared in include/nurbs.h
and implemented in src/libnurbs/opennurbs_ext.cpp. It outputs
intersection curves in 3d space and in both surfaces' UV parameter
spaces.</p>
<p>The approach of the algorithm originates from:</p>
<p>Adarsh Krishnamurthy, Rahul Khardekar, Sara McMains, Kirk Haller, and
Gershon Elber. 2008. Performing efficient NURBS modeling operations on
the GPU. In Proceedings of the 2008 ACM symposium on Solid and physical
modeling (SPM '08). ACM, New York, NY, USA, 257-268.
DOI=10.1145/1364901.1364937 <a href="http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/1364901.1364937">http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/1364901.1364937</a></p>
<p>It can be divided into several steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Generate the bounding box of the two surfaces.</li>
<li>If their bounding boxes intersect:<ul>
<li>Split the two surfaces, both into four parts, and calculate the
    sub-surfaces' bounding boxes</li>
<li>Calculate the intersection of sub-surfaces' bboxes, if they do
    intersect, go deeper with splitting surfaces and smaller bboxes,
    otherwise trace back.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>After getting the intersecting bboxes, approximate the surface
    inside the bbox with two triangles, and calculate the intersection
    points of the triangles (both in 3d space and two surfaces' UV
    space)</li>
<li>Fit the intersection points into polyline curves, and then to NURBS
    curves. Points with distance less than max_dis are considered in
    one curve.</li>
</ul>
<p>It needs to be mentioned here that the value max_dis can be provided by
the user or generated automatically.</p>
<p>Besides, after calculating the intersection curves, the next steps
towords evaluated NURBS are splitting the surfaces into sub-surfaces
with the intersection curves as their boundaries, and some
inside-outside tests to decide which sub-surfaces should be included in
the final object. Some work on splitting has been done, generating some
b-rep faces that can pass IsValid(), but still further work is needed.</p>
<h4 id="andrei-popescu-network-performance-testing">Andrei Popescu: Network Performance Testing</h4>
<p>The project that I have been working on during the summer, as part of
the Google Summer of Code program,
can be broken down into three independent parts and it consisted in
running various tests for the BRL-CAD
networking library(Libpkg) .</p>
<ul>
<li>Speed testing and investigations to uncover any potential
    performance bottleneck.</li>
<li>Unit tests and code review to find and cover any untreated
    exceptions(crashes) in the Libpkg library.</li>
<li>Eliminate the assumption of globals in the API.</li>
</ul>
<p>For the first part, I have run two types of tests :
Local ones, both the "sender" and the "receiver" were located on
localhost. The script gathered data
regarding the transmission speed for each set of package sizes (Here,
package refers to the package
created by networking library, not networking packages) respectively
file sizes.</p>
<p>Remote ones, where the "sender" and the "receiver" were on separate
machines, connected using SSH.
The script ran and the data gathered was done in the same way as the
localhost one.Using the data
obtained from the tests, two 3D graphs were drawn.However, the tests
were inconclusive, I could not find
an "ideal" package size to use regardless of file size.</p>
<p>After Mid-term I focused mostly on second part. I used test units from
libbu(Utility library) as an example
for the unit test type and design. When the mentioned tests were run,
several exceptions that caused
crashes were discovered. Lastly, I have written fixes for the discovered
crashes.</p>
<p>The third part of the project has not been covered yet, so more work is
needed.Although, I am doing my
best to finish it in the following weeks.</p>
<h4 id="chris-dueck-calculating-2d-sketch-surface-area">Chris Dueck: Calculating 2D Sketch Surface Area</h4>
<p>Calculating the surface area of a 2D Sketch primitive is not a trivial
task. Sketches are created interactively by the user, and can contain
straight line segments, circular arc segments (and full circles), as
well as Bezier and NURBS curves.</p>
<p>The method used to approximately compute the area of a 2D sketch is as
follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>1.) Approximate the sketch by a polygon</li>
<li>2.) Compute the area of the polygon exactly using Green's Theorem</li>
<li>3.) Add the areas of any circular arc segments that were created
    during (1)</li>
</ul>
<p>To approximate the sketch by a polygon, each possible curve type of a
sketch must be considered.</p>
<ul>
<li>If the curve is a straight line, it need not be approximated.</li>
</ul>
<!-- -->

<ul>
<li>If the curve is a circular arc, it must be determined if it is a
    full circle (in which case its area can be computed easily) or if it
    is a circular arc segment. If it is a circular arc segment, the line
    segment from the beginning of the arc to the endpoint is added to
    the polygon, and the excess area of the circular arc segment itself
    can be calculated easily
    (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circular_segment)</li>
</ul>
<!-- -->

<ul>
<li>If the curve is a Bezier curve, it can be approximated by a series
    of circular arcs. The algorithm used can be found here
    (http://itc.ktu.lt/itc354/Riskus354.pdf). The algorithm recursively
    subdivides the Bezier until it is approximated to tolerance by a
    biarc and uses the curvature value of the Bezier at a point to
    determine the depth of subdivision. Then each circular arc in the
    approximation of the Bezier curve is treated as above.</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, the area of the polygon can be efficiently calculated using
Green's Theorem
(http://www.softsurfer.com/Archive/algorithm_0101/algorithm_0101.htm#3D%20Standard%20Formula)
using cross products.</p>
<h4 id="cliff-yapp-nurbs-ray-tracing-in-brl-cad">Cliff Yapp: NURBS Ray Tracing in BRL-CAD</h4>
<p>Over the past year, an intense development effort by BRL-CAD's
development team has successfully implemented raytracing of Non-Uniform
Rational BSpline (NURBS) geometry within the BRL-CAD Computer-Aided
Design (CAD) package. NURBS surfaces are very general, very complex
mathematical shapes used by virtually all modern commercial CAD software
packages. Because BRL-CAD did not originally support this type of
geometry, commercial models could only be imported into BRL-CAD after a
labor-intensive and difficult conversion process from NURBS form to
triangle-base geometry (referred to in BRL-CAD as Bags-of-Triangles or
BoTs). The new NURBS raytracing capability builds on work by many
developers over a period of years, who in turn built on the open source
library OpenNURBS. Support for this primitive type means BRL-CAD can now
store and raytrace data from commercial models without requiring
preliminary conversion to another type of geometry.</p>
<p>The last major feature needed to make import of commercial models in
BRL-CAD straightforward is conversion support for ISO’s "Standard for
the Exchange of Product model data" or STEP file format. STEP uses NURBS
geometry in its definition, making support for NURBS geometry a
necessary prelude to support for STEP import. Most commercial CAD
modelers support this file format as an output option, hence STEP
support in BRL-CAD would allow a direct path for moving geometric
descriptions from a variety of commercial modelers to BRL-CAD.
Considerable progress has already been made on STEP import support, but
more work is need to bring the code and feature set to "production
quality". If anyone would like to join the BRL-CAD open source
development effort and has a little familiarity with C++, the step-g
converter and its supporting libraries have some simple-yet-useful tasks
that would be an excellent and very useful way to explore the project -

<h4 id="tan-yugin-brl-cads-code-hardening-efforts">Tan YuGin: BRL-CAD's Code Hardening Efforts</h4>
<p>A/N: Written as a Google Code-in 2013 task.</p>
<p>BRL-CAD is a large-scale software based on decades of development and
contains over a million lines of code. Its contributors are numerous and
come from countries all over the world. Any project of such magnitude is
bound to face problems with ensuring consistency and high standards
across its various aspects.</p>
<p>The core team behind BRL-CAD, however, has sought to alleviate such
issues as far as possible. In a ‘HACKING’ document included with the
rest of the software, the team has provided universal guidelines and
good practices for all BRL-CAD code, in areas such as code formatting,
organization, and conventions. BRL-CAD also encourages the use of
various tools to make it easier for them to check for problems or errors
in their work. These tools include the Simian similarity analyzer, a
program that detects duplicated code and allows developers to refactor
it into space-saving functions, and the built-in CPPCHECK-CLEANUP tool,
which checks for issues such as stylistic errors or unused functions.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="/wiki/img/Simian_analysis_sample_output.PNG" /></p>
<p><em>Sample output of Simian similarity analyzer. Screenshot courtesy of
BRL-CAD wiki.</em></p>
<p><img alt="" src="/wiki/img/CPPCHECK-CLEANUP_sample_output.PNG" /></p>
<p><em>Sample output of CPPCHECK-CLEANUP tool. Screenshot courtesy of BRL-CAD
wiki.</em></p>
<p>BRL-CAD enforces the practice of strict compilation, treating all of the
compiler’s warnings as matters that have to be resolved before
development can proceed. Any detected issues that are in actual fact
errors can thus be fixed. Even incorrectly detected errors are often due
to weaknesses in the code and can also be dealt with.</p>
<p>Finally, BRL-CAD has since 2006 participated in the Coverity Scan
Initiative, where a thorough source code analysis is performed and a
list of detected problems generated. In 2012, a team of core developers
met up in person and fixed over fifteen hundred of the issues reported
in the latest scan. This reduced BRL-CAD’s defect density to just 0.22
defects per thousand lines of code- less than a quarter of the industry
average.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="/wiki/img/CoverityExample2.png" /></p>
<p><em>Coverity analysis showing secure coding suggestions. Image courtesy of
BRL-CAD wiki.</em></p>
<p>Through a range of comprehensive guidelines and tools that help
contributors to ensure that their code abides by these rules, BRL-CAD
can thus be developed and contributed to by numerous programmers from
across the globe while simultaneously maintaining a high standard and
consistency of code, ultimately resulting in a feature-packed yet
well-refined software for the larger community.</p>
