<p>Covered below in detail are the expectations for Summer of Code students
that are accepted to participate. In addition to the <a href="../Acceptance/">acceptance
criteria</a> that all students are
required to abide by, there are participation and behavior expectations.</p>
<p>The program timeframe is <em>very</em> short. There's not much time to get up
to speed, so there is a need to be clear of what is expected. Also, many
students haven't done a lot of real-world development work previously.
On top of that, most mentors and students are in different locations so
coordinated interaction can be difficult at times. Because of this, it's
vitally important to the success of each student's project for all
expectations to be specified and understood before students begin coding
for the summer. This should be the first step in a long series of
frequent communication between student and their mentor(s).</p>
<p>This document walks through various expectations for students and
mentors, as well as addressing various ways to communicate effectively.</p>
<h1 id="the-point">The Point</h1>
<p>One of the primary purposes of the program is to introduce students to
real-world open source development where there are social,
collaboration, and other pragmatic concerns in addition to technical
implementation issues. It is our goal to integrate all participants as
full-fledged new developers on the project not just for the duration of
summer but thereafter too. The projects are a very important part of the
program, but they're certainly not the most important part. The point is
to have new developers join in development.</p>
<h1 id="full-time-effort">Full-time effort</h1>
<p>Unless otherwise discussed, students are expected to work about 40 hours
a week on their project. This is essentially a full-time job. If
students can't work this much or if there are periods of time when a
student will be away on vacation, then that needs to be discussed
beforehand with the mentors or project administrator. The mentors
shouldn't have to hunt you down to keep tabs on your activity either
(see Version control below).</p>
<h1 id="self-motivation-and-steady-schedule">Self-motivation and steady schedule</h1>
<p>The student is expected to be self-motivated. The mentor may push the
student to excel but if the student is not self-motivated to work, then
the student probably won't get much out of participating. The mentors
are there to help, but they're not supposed to be a crutch or substitute
for research and hard work.</p>
<p>The student should schedule time to work on the project each day and
keep to a regular schedule. It's not acceptable to fiddle around for
days on end and then pull an all-nighter just before deadlines. It will
show in code and in the evaluation.</p>
<h1 id="commit-access">Commit access</h1>
<p>Students are treated like any other contributor to the project. That
means that in order to get commit access, students need to be actively
involved and making small succinct patches at first and engender trust
with the existing developers. Once the student shows technical
competency, demonstrates respect for the <a href="http://brlcad.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/brlcad/brlcad/trunk/HACKING">developer
guidelines</a>,
and is known to work well with the other developers, commit access will
be granted. <em>This should happen before coding begins.</em></p>
<h1 id="integrated-development">Integrated development</h1>
<p>This means that students should be working closely with the other
developers. Particularly for new projects, students are expected to keep
up-to-date and deal with the on-going developments of others (both good
and bad) just like any other developer on the project and is conscious
of making changes that might break protocol or compatibility. You're not
an outsider. You're joining a team.</p>
<h1 id="version-control">Version control</h1>
<p>Once a developer has commit access, they have a responsibility to work
cooperatively with the other developers. Particularly for open source
projects, the manner in which everyone commits conveys a lot of
information about the status, purpose, and directions of development.</p>
<p>DO:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>commit-early, commit-often</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>This allows issues to be caught quickly and prevents the dreaded
one-massive-commit-before-deadline. Developers can rarely ever commit
too frequently. They can very easily commit too infrequently. Once a day
is <em>far</em> too infrequent.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>use quality commit messages</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The history in version control is frequently the best timeline log of
what happened, why, and who did it. The commit messages should be
detailed and informative.</p>
<!-- -->

<p>Bad examples:</p>
<p>::* Fixed a bug.</p>
<p>::* Tweaks.</p>
<p>::* Improved version.</p>
<p>Good examples:</p>
<p>::* modify bu_temp_file() so that we can capture the name of the
temporary file that was created along with the opened file descriptor.
this requires ditching tmpfile_s() entirely on windows since it returns
anonymous files, instead providing an implementation of mkstemp() for
platforms like Windows that don't provide it.</p>
<p>::* accept karel's sf patch 1802016, which provides a -p option to
pix-fb causing the application to pause the specified number of seconds
before exiting and closing the framebuffer.</p>
<p>::* fixed a bug encountered when ray-tracing really tiny TGC objects
(sub-millimeter size) caused by the REC prep routine thinking it was a
valid right elliptical cone (when it wasn't). the problem was due to a
bad magnitude check and an insufficient hard-coded 'smallness' constant.
the result was rays that would miss portions of the tgc entirely, only
counting the 'middle' portion that would have corresponded with an REC.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>refer to specific bug numbers, links, and issues as much as
    possible</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>AVOID:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>checking in multiple non-related changes in one big commit</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>If something is bad about one of the changes and someone needs to roll
it back, it's more difficult to do so. Make each commits succinct and
functional, even if it means a little extra work.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>checking in changes that haven't been tested</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Each commit should at least compile for the person that makes the
commit. New developers that break the build are used for target
practice.</p>
<h1 id="frequent-communication-with-mentor">Frequent communication with mentor</h1>
<p>Frequent communication with your mentor is a <strong>must</strong>. The student
should make sure the mentor has a good idea of:</p>
<ul>
<li>what you're currently working on</li>
<li>how far you've gotten</li>
<li>how you're implementing it</li>
<li>what you plan on working on next</li>
<li>what issues have come up</li>
<li>what you did to get around them</li>
<li>what's blocking you if you're stuck</li>
</ul>
<p>The mentor is one of the most valuable resources to students. The
mentors are generally already solid contributors with a long track
record of involvement with the project. The mentor likely has worked on
the project for long enough to know the history of decisions, how things
are architected, the other people involved, the process for doing
things, and all other cultural lore that will help the student be most
successful.</p>
<p>Before coding begins, the mentor and student should iron out answers to
the following questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>What is the communication schedule? Daily? Every two days? Mondays,
    Wednesdays, Fridays?</li>
<li>What is the best medium to use for regular, scheduled communication?
    IRC? Mailing list e-mails? Instant messenger? VOIP? Telephone call?
    Face-to-face?</li>
<li>What is the best medium to use for non-scheduled communication? IRC?
    Mailing list e-mails?</li>
</ol>
<p>DO:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>keep your mentor up to date as much as possible</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>This forces you to be more organized and it gives your mentor a chance
to help you out if you're having trouble.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>let your mentor know what your schedule is</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Are you going on vacation, moving, writing papers for class? If your
mentor doesn't know where you'll be or to expect a lag in your
productivity, your mentor can't help you course correct or plan
accordingly.</p>
<p>AVOID:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>going for more than a week without communicating with your
    mentor</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The project timeline doesn't allow for unplanned gaps in communication.
Students should talk to their mentor at least once a week to update them
on their status whether the mentor asks for it or not.</p>
<h1 id="communication-with-project">Communication with project</h1>
<p><strong>Students should not discuss development in private.</strong> This includes
refraining from private IRC discussions as well as private e-mails even
with your mentor unless the discussion involves personal information.
Other developers need to be aware of the progress, discussions, and
decisions being made even if they're not a part of that process. It also
affords other developers the opportunity to get involved if they have an
interest. Don't be shy, speak up publicly.</p>
<ul>
<li>IRC</li>
</ul>
<p>Students should be available via IRC while they are working. This allows
for interactive discussions with other developers and other students as
well as increased visibility.</p>
<ul>
<li>Mailing list</li>
</ul>
<p>Many of the mentors may not be available on IRC due to differences in
time zones or familiarity with IRC as a communication medium. Students
should get to know their mentor and if mailing list discussions are
preferred, the students should also be interactive and visible on the
developer mailing list.</p>
<h1 id="resolving-problems">Resolving problems</h1>
<p>Student can call upon any mentor or other developer, they don't have to
limit their interactions to just their mentor. They shouldn't limit
their interactions to just one mentor. Students having difficulties
communicating with any mentor should contact the
<a href="/wiki/user/Sean">administrator</a>.</p>
<p>If you're stuck, ask for help on IRC and/or on the mailing list. If you
are still stuck, read the source code. If you're still stuck, ask for
help again. Better questions frequently yield better answers.</p>
<h1 id="design-documents">Design documents</h1>
<p>It's a good idea for the student to maintain design documents during the
course of development. These design documents should cover:</p>
<ol>
<li>the project plan, with additional detail to flesh out the original
    program application</li>
<li>deviations from the project plan and how and why the original design
    plan changed</li>
<li>any issues that could not be worked out or overcome</li>
<li>possible future directions</li>
<li>any resources used or relevant specifications</li>
</ol>
<p>The student and mentor should work out what design document(s) should be
maintained during the course of the summer. <strong>The design documents
should be added to the wiki.</strong></p>
<p>-- Thanks --</p>
<p>Thank you to each student for doing your best to follow through with
these expectations. Students should consult with any mentor if there are
any questions or concerns regarding these expectations.</p>
