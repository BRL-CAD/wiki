<p>This page is intended to lay out the basic "<strong>rules and requirements</strong>"
that our organization requires of all Summer of Code (whether
<a href="Google_Summer_of_Code.md">GSoC</a> or
<a href="ESA_Summer_of_Code_in_Space.md">SOCIS</a>) participants whose
project proposals are accepted. Unless otherwise arranged with the
organization administrator (contact 'brlcad' via IRC on
irc.freenode.net), it will be expected that all students will comply
with the requirements outlined below.</p>
<h1 id="application-recommendations">Application Recommendations</h1>
<h2 id="make-a-patch">Make a patch</h2>
<p>While this is <strong><em>optional</em></strong>, it greatly increase your chances of being
selected. Basically, a patch is some change to the software (submitted
wither as a patch file or a pull request). If working with us is your
top priority, a patch will help us see how well you are at dealing with
other people's code. Don't worry, though. It doesn't need to be more
than a few lines. It can be a bug fix or implement some minor feature.
It's more important that it applies without hassle and provides some
improvement. This is one of several opportunities to impress, so be
creative. Link to any patches in your application.</p>
<h2 id="come-talk-to-us">Come talk to us</h2>
<p>You <strong><em>really</em></strong> should be talking to developers long before you submit
an application. Discuss your ideas via IRC and e-mail (mailing list).
Communication is a huge part of our evaluation criteria.</p>
<h2 id="maintain-a-dev-log">Maintain a dev log</h2>
<p>It's strongly recommended that you maintain a public development log
that is updated every day you work. Most students don't have a habit of
discussing their work adequately and this intrinsically documents
progress. Communication ftw. Dev logs are also a great way to let people
in the community follow your project and provides a place to showcase
cool highlights!</p>
<h1 id="participation-requirements">Participation Requirements</h1>
<h2 id="license-appropriately">License appropriately</h2>
<p>Participation requires that any work performed will be provided in good
faith and consistent with contributor requirements. Unless approved in
advance in writing, all rights (copyright) will be <strong>assigned</strong> to the
organization. If your country does not allow assignment of copyright,
non-exclusive rights to use the code in perpetuity will be required. You
will be credited for your work regardless.</p>
<h2 id="report-activity-daily">Report activity daily</h2>
<p>In addition to your ongoing discussions, it is required to regularly
<em>submit a progress report</em> of <strong>daily</strong> activity. These reports usually
won't need to be more than a sentence or two but they should provide
clear concise information on what you did, things you discovered, tasks
completed, difficulties encountered, milestones reached, days off, and
other similar details. If you did nothing, that's okay! We want to know
when you're concentrating on code, at the beach, and everything in
between.</p>
<h2 id="list-your-milestones">List your milestones</h2>
<p>Everyone is required to submit a <strong>minimum</strong> of three and a maximum of
ten project <em>milestones</em>. These are not deliverables but, rather, are
overall tasks that should be completed throughout the duration of your
work. These should be necessary implementation steps and not include any
research or familiarity phases. In the end, there is code that must be
produced and your milestones should be a (very) rough breakdown for
estimating your progress. These milestones should be <strong>published in your
first progress report,</strong> that is, at the beginning of coding.</p>
<h2 id="be-communicative">Be communicative</h2>
<p>All students will be expected to be reachable via chat (e.g., IRC or
Zulip) and e-mail while they are working. Participants must be
responsive, actively engaged in discussions, and available for
questions, comments, and suggestions from other developers. See
<a href="http://irchelp.org">here</a> if you are new to IRC and need help.</p>
<h1 id="coding-requirements">Coding Requirements</h1>
<h2 id="compile-and-run">Compile and run</h2>
<p>Being able to compile and run on your own hardware is a very <em>basic
task</em> that is considered essential. We're more than happy to help you
get started the first time if you run into a problem, but you are
expected to put forth duly diligent effort. Additionally, understanding
the existing user community is <strong>very important</strong> for most developers to
have at least a basic familiarity. In the end, your changes will
(hopefully) be pushed out to the community and you should be cognizant
of what that will <em>mean</em>.</p>
<h2 id="be-familiar-with-revision-control">Be familiar with revision control</h2>
<p>You will be expected to abide by the same coding requirements of other
developers. You must know the basics for how to work with the project's
revision control system including checking out/in changes, resolving
conflicts, and creating patches. Whether you work on a branch or on the
mainline trunk will depend on the project.</p>
<h2 id="evaluate-performance">Evaluate performance</h2>
<p>Performance is something we always strive to keep in mind.
<strong>Quantitatively evaluate your performance</strong> and the impact your
modifications will make. Don't prematurely optimize and don't
over-architect, but also don't make guesses or assumptions either. Use a
performance profiler, test your code, add debug timers, and/or have a
peer review your work.</p>
<h2 id="write-maintainable-code">Write maintainable code</h2>
<p>This requirement cannot be stressed enough. How maintainable is your end
result. This is not only maintainability from the stand-point of source
code longevity, but involves other higher-level aspects. Does your
implementation use interfaces, languages, tools, or techniques that
introduce some new development requirement? If so, that choice needs to
be discussed and <strong>justified</strong> or otherwise mitigated. Any new external
dependencies need to be approved by the core developers. Is your code
comprehensive and comprehensible? Well-documented? Organized? You are
required to follow existing dev guidelines, code style, and established
conventions.</p>
<h2 id="write-portable-code">Write portable code</h2>
<p>We appreciate code being as portable as possible with effort continually
taken to make sure code works on a variety of environments. While each
developer's perception of what is <em>reasonable</em> certainly fluctuates over
the years and from developer to developer, the general intention is that
code written should function the <strong>same</strong> on most moderately popular
operating system environments. It is each dev's responsibility to either
make sure their code isn't platform-specific or that equivalent
functionality is implemented for other maintained platforms. You are
expected to interact with other devs when portability issues are raised
and to promptly resolve any problems. Portability of any dependencies
being used must similarly be taken into account and relates to the
aforementioned maintainability requirement.</p>
<h2 id="write-complete-code">Write complete code</h2>
<p>Perhaps treat each week like it is your last. You should be able to hand
over functional code over just about any time during development (within
a day or so) to another developer. Focus on completing tasks, completing
code features, and working on keeping your code functional at <strong>all</strong>
stages of development. That way, no matter how far you get on your
milestones or deliverable(s), other developers will be able to review,
test, and readily integrate your code. Plan your development approach
accordingly. You should generally not "stub" code functionality (though
comments are good), but instead focus on coding "deep" instead of
"wide". It's generally preferred to have 2 features that work fully,
than 5 features that half-work or even 20 features that are all 90%
complete.</p>
