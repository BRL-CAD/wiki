# Google Summer Of Code 2013

## My preparation for the Project:

-   Joined IRC channel \#brlcad
-   I have mailed in the mailing list of BRL-CAD talking about my
    interests and planning for near future.
-   Surfed through previous year projects where I found one similar
    project. I am also in contacting with that candidate who would guide
    me and share her experience with me.
-   Cloned the source-code into my system.
-   Opened some src files, saw some codes and found huge cod repition
    over there. \*As my first step, I had modified the file
    /src/libbn/plot3 and reduced some amount of code.
-   I didn't have previous experience with SVN version control system.
    Made an account on sourceforge.net and submitted my [first
    patch.](https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&atid=640804&aid=3611485&group_id=105292)
-   Two very basic simple patches till now-
    -   [Patch1](https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&atid=640804&aid=3611485&group_id=105292)
    -   [Patch2](http://sourceforge.net/p/brlcad/patches/172/)
-   Looked through project ideas list and found two ideas quite
    interesting- one related to refactoring the source of BRL-CAD and
    other source of STEP library.
-   Went through issues of STEPcode on github.
-   Due to the burden of final exams I am afraid that I couldn't work to
    my maximum potential till 30th April. But from 1st May to May 3rd, I
    am planning to submit some more patches to show my work.

## Projects and Priorities:

I am planning to submit three proposals and the priorities with which I
want to get engaged in summer are as follows-

### Priority 1: ["Code Reduction and Refactoring for Reduced Maintenance Cost"](http://brlcad.org/wiki/User:KeshaSShah/GSoC13/Priority1)

-   This was the project which first caught my eyes and I was attracted
    towards working with BRL-CAD. I looked at the files in source folder
    and was able to understand it to quite a good extent. I am highly
    confident about this project that I can contribute the best in me in
    this domain.

### Priority 2: ["STEP Libraries"](http://brlcad.org/wiki/User:KeshaSShah/GSoC13/Priority2)

-   Being frank, I came in contact with STEP a few days ago when I was
    going through Converting Geometry and Exchange of CAD data between
    different software packages. This project deals with improving code
    libraries in terms of performance and maintenance and needs to be
    documented. I am also planning to include some BRL-CAD wiki pages as
    it lacks a detailed one now.

### Priority 3: ["STEP AP242 Parser"](http://brlcad.org/wiki/User:KeshaSShah/GSoC13/Priority3)

-   I think this project can give me a great learning opportunity. Right
    now I am trying to compile and understand file-wise how the current
    hardwired AP203 is being currently parsed. I am yet in the
    pre-development planning phase for this project, I will be updating
    it on the wiki page.
