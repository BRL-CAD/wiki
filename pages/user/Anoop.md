# Project information

## Project title

Consolidate Image Processing

## Abstract

BRL-CAD has a number of image processing tools used (among other things)
to post-process raytrace images. As of current implementation all image
conversion and graphic functionality in BRL-CAD are handled by
individual tools (separate executables). Currently, an effort is
underway to migrate image manipulation logic into library code (LIBICV).
This task would complete work already begun on bu_image and the image
conversion library (LIBICV), and convert all existing image conversion
tools to a new programming library. Advantage of doing such a task is to
increase maintainability of the code and allow application users to
easily use BRL-CAD functionality into their own applications.
