Online Geometry Viewer Front-End, production ready at the end of
GSoC'15

**IN ORDER OF PRIORITY**

-   **Landing Page**

Landing page is almost empty. It should explain to users how to use OGV
in say, "X" simple steps like <https://360.autodesk.com/viewer>. Use
graphics (images of 3D models, or explain steps graphically etc.)
(8-9 Days)

-   **Loader Indicator**

There should be indication about how much model has been loaded. E.g.
“67% loaded”.
(1 week)

-   **Feedback system Front-End**

UI or the Front-End for sending the developer feedbacks and reporting
bugs will be created.
(5-6 Days)

-   **Error Messages**
    -   **Proper Error Messages**

While saving details during file uploading, it shows a red error box
without error message and those red error boxes keep on stacking when
one clicks on save button multiple times.

-   -   **g to obj Conversion Failed Message**

If g to obj conversion fails, user should be notified in user friendly
manner with instructions to do the needful. User’s time never be wasted
at any cost.

-   **Upload Model without Sign-In / Sign-Up : ( Discarded for now, to
    be done at the later stage )**

User should be able to upload model without signin/signup. That will
help to engage users in OGV.
(10 Days)

-   **Design a 404 Page**

Design / Create a 404 page if user search or goto wrong url.
(4 Days)

-   **Zoom Limit**

There is a range of zoom-in and zoom-out within which every model can be
viewed or say, visible. Restrict user not to zoom-in and zoom-out beyond
those limits.
(10 Days)

-   **Swtich to Different View**

An option needed that enable user to quickly see back, front, top,
bottom, left, right view of the model and switch among them.
(8-9 Days)

-   **Responsiveness**

Make it mobile first site. For UI improvement I'm going to use "zurb
foundation" or "Twitter Bootstrap".
(1 week)

**Documentation**

It would be done side by side at the end of every milestone as much as
possible.
