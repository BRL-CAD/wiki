**Current Task:**

The idea is to build a geometry viewer application that generates a
standalone double-clickable file that views a given model. The approach
is to concatenate the contents of a given “.g” file with the function
calls from librt, libdm that parse and display a “.g” file, in a
standard brlcad setup.
