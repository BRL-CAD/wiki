## About myself

I am Mesut Özdogan from Germany. I am studying media and applied
information technology at the university of applied sciences Dusseldorf.
On 24'th may I will get my degree.
In my free time I love it to develop. I have tried many directions,
especially web development and db-dev, after the half of my studies I
have decided to become more specialized in computer graphics. Now I am
at the beginning and gaining more and more knowledge.

### Reference

In my bachelor thesis I have developed a education application for
computer graphic lectures. The application renders a scene through a
self coded Raytracer. At the same time the steps of ray calculation and
tracing is visualized by a OpenGL window.

In my free time, which was about zero in the last moths, I develop games
for mobile devices.
I have some experience in Java, C++, PHP and MySQL.

## GSoC 2012 Project

I will develop a cross platform display manager with the Qt libraries.

## Abstract

The graphical output of applications are done by a display manager.
Every operating system has its own characteristics. The graphicssytem of
application has to adjusted to them. As a result the administration
effort will increase. A cross-platform implementation would provide a
easy maintainable display manager. For the BRL-CAD application a
cross-platform display manager will be developed.

### Additional Info

For the cross-platform display manager we will use Qt libraries. The
graphical output will be displayed by a QPainter instance.

### Milestones

`- get configuration how depth, background colour,...`
`- initialize a QPainter on a QPicture canvas`
`- Draw Lines`
`- Draw LineLists`
`- Draw Text`
`- Set states how line width, style, colour...`
`- load matrixes, view and transformation`
`- set transparency`
