## Bonding with Organisation

I have installed BRL-CAD on my system on 8 March 2016 successfully. Now,
I'm in touch with the community. I'm interested in OGV back ground
project. I put my first mail to community on 9 March 2016.

I have installed all the required things for this project as refered by
Shubham Chauhan. The Git page is:
<https://github.com/BRL-CAD/OGV-meteor>

## Problem Faced( 11 March 2016 )

When I'm going to open meteor, it shows error as:

"Unable to update package catalog (are you offline?)

If you are using Meteor behind a proxy, set HTTP_PROXY and HTTPS_PROXY
environment variables or see this page for more details:"

I searched about it alot but still facing this problem.
