## Benchmark Performance Database

### Abstract

This project aims to provide more channels to the users to submit the
benchmark logs of their brlcad installations ( via the web API, ftp, scp
in addition to the existing channel of email), implement an efficient
storage and retrieval of logs (via the database and the archiving of the
files) and provide an interface to access the logs via graphical means
or otherwise.
