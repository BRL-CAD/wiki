## GSoC 2012 project ideas

I will most likely have adequate time to put together two proposals this
year. These are the project I'm currently reviewing (in order of
interest).

| **[STEP Viewer](/wiki/STEP_Viewer.md):** This sounds really interesting, but I'll have to look into whether my skills are up to par.                                                                                                                     | N/A                                                                     |
| **[Add -exec option to 'search'](/wiki/Add_exec_option_to_search.md):** This involves obtaining an array of available commands, which is currently impossible (well, doing it the right way). Search isn't the only feature with a use for such a thing. | [Drafting proposal](gsoc2012/search_proposal.md) |
| **\[<http://>/\~sean/ideas.html Add a volume, surface area, centroid, and medial axis routine to all primitives:\]** This is probably not that difficult to start implementing, although I would have to learn the required math.                          | N/A                                                                     |
