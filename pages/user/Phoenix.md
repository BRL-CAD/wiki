# Experience

-   I have strong skills in C/C++, as well as OOP, since I have taken
    some courses on it, and have finished some small projects with it.
-   I'm good at data structures and algorithms, for I have taken two
    honor track classes on them (Data Structures and Algorithms & Disign
    and Analysis of Algorithms) and got lots of practice.
-   I have a quite solid mathematics background, and I participated in
    mathematics contests for many times and get many awards.
-   I participated in GSoC 2012 for BRL-CAD, and spent my summer on the
    NURBS projects.
-   I'm also quite good at Operating System Development.

# GSoC 2012 Project

It's my first year to participate in GSoC.

This summer I am involved in the project of ["Implicit to NURBS
conversion"](../task/Implicit_to_NURBS_conversion.md), which
is to convert implicit CSG primitives to BREPs.

# GSoC 2013 Project

This year I'm so glad to once again be accepted to work for BRL-CAD.

I'd like to continue work on the [NURBS
Intersection] (../NURBS_Intersections.md) project, which is
partially finished last summer.
