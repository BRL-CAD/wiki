### Coding Period

# Week 1( Export [Part](http://brlcad.org/tmp/primitives/part.png) )

25 May

-   Understand particale and take reference from other converters

I understood how the coordinates of vertices of particale are stored.
Now I'm working on exporting the vertices and then move on to export
into POV-Ray format.

26 May

My ubuntu got crashed so I have to reinstall it. I will be compiling
BRL-CAD after that I am on track again.

Today I was busy in my exam. But in evening I got time to export
particale.

28 May

# Pre-midterm Evaluation Summary

I have started my GSOC with part primitive. Its easy for me to export
coordinates of part. Then I export part into POV-Ray by using
Round_Cone2 object. In next week it started exporting Ell. I found it
difficult as I was not able to rotate ellipse but in last I export ell
into POV-Ray by using spheroid object. In week third, I was working on
arb8. Its harder for me to export. So I discussed it with POV-Ray
community and finally I wrote a macro and I was able to export arb8
successfully. In 4th week, I export tgc successfully. In last week, I
clean up code and submit POV-Ray converter as a
[patch](http://sourceforge.net/p/brlcad/patches/378/). I was also
working on Linuxcnc in these pre-midterm days. I wrote stepconf help
pages that will be used while user click on help button of stepconf of
linuxcnc.

I have exported many other peimitives into POV-Ray. After mid term
evaluation I discussed with my mentor about linuxCNC project. Due to
lack of knowledge about linuxcnc machines and motivation we decided to
move with POV-Ray export project. So I started exporting primitives into
POV-Ray. I was feeling difficult to choose between primitive so I
discussed it with my mentor. He gave me a list by which I was able to
work in order. I have exported many primitives as listed below RHC, RPC,
EPA, EHY, ARBN, Half, ELL1, ELLg. One of these primitive is BoT which
required some modification. I was in difficulty in exporting it but
after spending time on it I was able to export it successfully and now
its working correctly. I also exported HRT primitive in POV-Ray but its
not similar to heart. But I'm very thankful to my mentor who gave me a
chance to increase my skills and motivation to do work with proper
methods as I never expected that I will able to export these given
primitives in proposal opn time but thanks to mentor and God who
motivate me to work and I was able to export more primitives along with
those given in proposal.
