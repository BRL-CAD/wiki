This page describes the current multi-lingual policy on brlcad.org.

## Help: namespace

Within the `Help:` namespace we are building a set of [public domain
help pages](Project:PD_help.md). The aim is to provide a basic
set of help pages that may be imported into new wikis covering the basic
editing and usage instructions. These should be translated into as many
languages as possible.

-   English is the main reference language, and all root pages should be
    named and written in English.
-   Other languages should be placed in an appropriately named sub-page
    of the English version. E.g. the French version of
    [Help:Contents](Help:Contents.md) should be at
    [Help:Contents/fr](Help:Contents/fr.md) (not Help:Sommaire,
    Aide:Sommaire or Help:Sommaire/fr).
-   Language sub-pages should be named using the appropriate language
    code for that language (see [below](#Language_codes.md)).
-   Sub-pages should *only* be used for translations into other
    languages, not for English content (e.g. you shouldn't use
    `Table editing/example` - use `Table editing example` or
    `Example of table editing` instead).
-   If an international version of a page exists but an English version
    does not, then please create a stub article for the English version
    as this aids navigation.
-   All pages in the help namespace should be tagged with the
    `{{`[`Languages`](template:Languages.md)`}}` template, which
    automatically creates links to all available translations.

This system will be compatible with the planned [automated import/export
of Help pages] (Automating_help_page_export.md), but may need a
bit of working around to export/import non-English pages in the interim.

## The main page

The English version of our front page is located at
[Main_Page](../doc/Main_page.md). Translated versions are located at
Main_Page/code, where code is the language code (e.g.
[Main_Page/es] (Main_page/es.md)). Please see [Project:Main page
templates](Project:Main_page_templates.md) for more details
about creating or editing this content.

Importantly, the rules about language codes (see
[below](#Language_codes.md)) should be followed here as well.
