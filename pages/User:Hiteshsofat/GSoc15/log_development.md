-   solved this problem:- The right subnav goes away on my mobile, so
    there is no way to navigate to a different documentation section if
    I want to
-   solved this problem:-The subnav should be sticky. If I am reading a
    long documentation page, I shouldn't have go back to the top of the
    page to move to a different documentation page.
-   solved this problem:-The word 'BRL-CAD Main Menu' is a bit confusing
    to me if all it does is encapsulate the search bar.
-   solved this problem:- \[Minor\] The font-size of documentation is a
    little big, 14px should be ideal for readability.
-   solved this problem:-I suggest putting search and navigation on the
    left, but keeping languages, editing options, and other options
    specific to the document being viewed on the right.
-   solved this problem:-changing the title to “Search Documents”
-   solved this problem:- Some pages, the images are not displaying at
    the right scale, for example
    <http://202.164.53.122/wordpress/articles/en/build_pattern.php>
-   solved this problem:-Move the edit button out of the content pane
    closer with the language options.

<h3>

I have done these work

</h3>

-   there are several duplicates in the Additional Languages list
    including Spanish and Spainish (twice)
-
-   selecting any of the Additional Languages does not seem to work for
    me, clicking the language name doesn’t appear to be doing anything
-   BRLCAD MAIN MENU” link is redundant with the top menu bar, suggest
    removing
-   search and the hierarchy menu should be on the left, keeping the
    doc-specific options on the right
    `       • the horizontal menu padding is using too much space, suggest removing`
    `       • "Additional Languages” should be a link that displays the languages, not just the small arrow`
-   `       • the flags do not line up for the manual translation list and the additional languages list`
-   `       • the “Change Language” label is unnecessary, implied with the language links`
-   `       • selecting any of the top-level options (e.g., Lessons or Articles) displays the first document in that section`
    `               • this is unexpected behavior`
    `               • suggest requiring that a top-level category have a content menu be defined in the source repo or just display the submenu as the content if one does not exist.`
-   `       • as the main page content extends underneath the menu bar, selecting article links ends up displaying content under the menu`
    `               • e.g., `[`http://202.164.53.122/wordpress/books/en/BRL-`](http://202.164.53.122/wordpress/books/en/BRL-)
    CAD_Tutorial_Series-VolumeII.php\#Lesson-8
-   `       • displaying a presentation would benefit greatly from a different stylesheet customized for presentations`
    `               • e.g., `[`http://202.164.53.122/wordpress/presentations/en/brlcad-app-devel.php`](http://202.164.53.122/wordpress/presentations/en/brlcad-app-devel.php)
-   `       • searching doesn’t work, only returns "Your Searched Documents are:-“`
