This project will expose some of the low-level NMG routines to a
command-line interface. Users will be able to add and remove various
parts of the NMG data structure, such as regions and shells, along with
manipulation of vertices, edges, and faces. A similar set of
command-lines will allow for manipulation of "Bag of Triangles" (BoT)
data-structures. Users will see the results displayed in either MGED or
Archer.
