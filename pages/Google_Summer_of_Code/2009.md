# Getting started

**BRL-CAD participated as a mentoring organization in the 2009 Google
Summer of Code**. Students that participated with BRL-CAD in GSoC 2009
had a **[CHECKLIST](Google_Summer_of_Code/Checklist.md)** of
actions that they performed to help them get started.

# Additional Information

You can go to our [Project
Ideas](Google_Summer_of_Code/2009/Project_Ideas.md) page for a
list of project suggestions that were of particular interest. There were
also several [other areas](http://brlcad.org/~sean/ideas.html) of
development that were of high-interest. Students were welcome to submit
their own ideas as well but, more importantly, they were encouraged to
collaborate with the developers on formulating projects. Student
applications for GSoC were accepted at <http://socghop.appspot.com>
between March 23 and April 3.
