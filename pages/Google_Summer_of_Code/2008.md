After a detailed [evaluation and
review](../Summer_of_Code/Proposal_Evaluation.md) period, we
requested and were approved to mentor four students for the 2008 Google
Summer of Code. Our students were selected from among nearly two dozen
applicants based on their potential as a new long-term developer, their
ability to communicate effectively, the quality of their project
proposal, their technical ability, and our ability to effectively mentor
them.

# Student selections

It was a competitive selection process with several great applicants
that had to be turned away but in the end, our four selections were
made. Thanks go out to all of our applicants, and I hope to see many of
them stay involved in BRL-CAD development regardless of GSoC. That's one
of the many perks of being an open source project -- the door is always
open for new contributors. Thanks are also deserved to all our available
mentors and backup mentors that did a great job of weighing the pros and
cons of each proposal, interacting with the candidates, making the
difficult decisions, and ultimately choosing an exciting mix of students
and projects for GSoC 2008. That said and without further adieu, I'm
happy to announce our four selected students and their accepted
projects:

## Timothy Van Ruitenbeek

### Implementing Solid of Revolution and Sweep Primitives


Mentored by Daniel Roßberg, Timothy's project aims to implement two
primitives that have been requested numerous times over the years: sweep
and revolve. These two primitives provide a wide range of modeling
benefits including the ability to express various complex shapes more
intuitively and easily. Such shapes that will become readily possible to
construct include lathe shapes, cables, blends, carved shapes, and much
more.

## André Castelo Branco Gomes

### Global Illumination Renderer using Metropolis Light Transport and LIBRT


Mentored by Erik Greenwald, André's project involves implementing a new
global illumination renderer using BRL-CAD's existing LIBRT ray-trace
library. This rendering technique provides highly realistic image
synthesis (pretty pictures!) through a variant of the Monte-carlo method
and bidirectional path tracing. This will make it much easier to
generate beautiful detailed renderings of any BRL-CAD geometry without
requiring polygonal tessellation.

## Dawn Thomas

### Parametric Equations and Constraint Support


Mentored by John Anderson, Dawn's project is a highly ambitious effort
that aims to provide constraints and parametric equation support for
BRL-CAD geometry. Parametric constraints allows geometry to be described
in very powerful and expressive ways including constructing geometry
that preserves tangency, stays aligned through complex transformations,
maintains relative dimensions, resolves dependent articulations, and
more.

## Manuel Antonio Fernandez Montecelo

### New GUI Framework for Modeling and Visualization


Mentored by Bob Parker, Manuel's project is the start of a new graphical
user interface (GUI) for visualizing, manipulating, and managing BRL-CAD
geometry. This interface serves as a solid framework for improving
BRL-CAD's usability by providing support for shaded displays, scene
graph management, and more. This thin client is the start of a new user
interface that will focus on usability, efficiency, scalability, and the
human-computer interaction.

# Getting started

Students participating with BRL-CAD in the 2008 GSoC have a
**[checklist](../Summer_of_Code/Checklist.md)** of actions to
attend to before getting started on their projects. They are also
expected to be aware of what is **[expected of
them](../Summer_of_Code/Expectations.md)** throughout the summer.

# Additional Information

This year, more than 7000 applications were received from nearly 4000
students for the 175 participating organizations. Of those, only 1125
applications/students will be funded. Altogether, this represents a $5.6
million dollar (USD) investment by Google in open source software
development. Way cool.

You can see our [Project Ideas](2008/Project_Ideas.md) page for a list
of project suggestions that were suggested to be of particular
interest to our mentors for 2008. There were several [other
areas](http://brlcad.org/~sean/ideas.html) of development that are of
high-interest as well. Students were welcome to submit their own
unique ideas as well and were encouraged to collaborate with our
mentors on formulating those projects. Student applications for GSoC
2008 were accepted on Google's project website between March 24 and
March 31 at <http://code.google.com/soc/2008/>
