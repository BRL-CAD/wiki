# Getting started

**BRL-CAD participated as a mentoring organization in the 2011 Google
Summer of Code!**

Students interested in working on BRL-CAD for GSoC were asked to review
our **[CHECKLIST](Summer_of_Code/Checklist.md)** and our
[Project Ideas](Google_Summer_of_Code/Project_Ideas.md) page for
a list of project suggestions that were of particular interest.

# Accepted Proposals

In the past, we've received several dozen applications by the submission
deadline. We generally narrow down our selections to ten or fewer of the
more passionately interested students. From those that make the final
ten, we've previously selected four or five to participate. This year,
we chose to only accept two applicants in order to concentrate more
attention on their efforts.
