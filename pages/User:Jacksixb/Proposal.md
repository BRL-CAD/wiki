## Molecular Graphics Programming for Import and Visualization

### Academic Focus Areas:


Computer Science, Biology, Chemistry

### Summary:


The study endeavors to learn fundamentals of computer programming and
computer science concepts in order to import and visualize molecular
structures within an engineering context. The study requires learning
numerous computer science fundamentals including concepts of data
management, pointer manipulation, data structures, object-oriented
design, procedural workflows, file input/output, and 3D visualization.
It also requires learning several applied scientific concepts involving
molecular graphics, molecular engineering, biological molecular
structures, chemical structures, and common data formats. In order to
demonstrate the academic objectives, computer programming source code
will be implemented to read molecular data from public repository
Protein Data Bank (PDB) files. The PDB data will be converted into 3D
geometry inside of BRL-CAD and subsequently visualized via ray tracing.

### Goals:

1.  Finish Calc Class (10/18)
2.  Gain fundamental understanding of File I/O in C/C++ (10/31)
3.  Gain fundamental understanding of data structures in C/C++
4.  Gain fundamental understanding of protein structures and molecular
    graphics
5.  Gain fundamental understanding of 3D geometry and rendering

### Assignments:

1.  Data structures program: pointer fundamentals and data abstraction
    (10/26)
2.  File I/O program: methods for reading text and binary (11/2)
3.  Recursion program: procedurally generated geometry
4.  Software design: object-oriented and procedural workflow analysis
5.  Midterm report (1/18)
6.  Parse PDB file into a data structure
7.  Create simple molecular geometry from PDB data
8.  Putting it all together: “pdb-g: PDB to BRL-CAD importer”
9.  Molecular structures visualization survey
10. Visualization of molecular geometry, ray tracing
11. Molecular geometry engineering analysis
12. Final report (5/31)
