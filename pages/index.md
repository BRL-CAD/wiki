# BRL-CAD Wiki

Welcome to the BRL-CAD Wiki! A wiki is a type of site that allows
visitors to directly contribute to the content of a website. The
intention of the BRL-CAD Wiki is to get *everyone* in the community
working together on providing the information that everyone needs. The
wiki is intended as a place for any documentation, tutorials, support,
examples, and other pieces of information that may be of use to others.
All are welcome to contribute and anyone may edit most of the wiki
pages. With everyone's help, we can make this a tremendous resource for
the CAD community.

Don't be shy with your contributions. Give editing a try and be proud of
your contributions! If you make a mistake, they're very easy to undo and
you don't even need to have an account created. If you do create an
account, however, you will be credited with the contribution in the
page's history.

So be **bold** and *improve our documentation*!
