## Devlog for GSOC 2018 Slic3r Project

Initially, I just used a slic3r issue as a devlog, but as I have moved
on to other areas of slic3r I have continued my log in other issues.

I started under the [main
issue](https://github.com/slic3r/Slic3r/issues/4397) for the face based
rotation feature.

Then I moved on to porting 3D views to cpp as logged
[here](https://github.com/lordofhyphens/Slic3r/issues/19).

I hit a few snags with that prevented me from making good progress so I
then began working on porting tests logged
[here](https://github.com/lordofhyphens/Slic3r/issues/36)

I helped finish up two functions
[make_skirt](https://github.com/lordofhyphens/Slic3r/pull/37) and
[process_layer](https://github.com/lordofhyphens/Slic3r/pull/38)

I have been working on implementing a solution to [using
g2/3](https://github.com/slic3r/Slic3r/issues/23#issuecomment-408713962).
