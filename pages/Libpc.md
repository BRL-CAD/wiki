## libpc: Introduction

## Objectives

The objectives encompassed by libpc are the following

-   **Front-end**

1.  An Abstraction of Parameters over the present components of
    primitives
2.  Representation of complex (see examples) constraints between
    Parameters
3.  Framework for selection of Design/Alternative Configurations

-   **Back-end**

1.  Fast Geometric Constraint Solution

### Advantages

1.  Reduction of Modeling time in case of Iterative designs
2.  Logic of Design represented in the geometry file itself
3.  Capability for complex geometry generation

## Constraint Satisfaction Process

## Possible Approaches in BRL-CAD

## Structure

libpc is composed of the following modules

1.  Reprsentation of Parameters and Constraints in Storage
2.  Representation of Parameters in Memory
3.  Representation of Constraints in Memory / DataStructure
    1.  Associated MathGrammar and MathVM
4.  Generation of 2 and 3 from 1
5.  Solution System
    1.  Constraint Network Generation from 4
    2.  Constraint Satisfaction
6.  Parameter and Geometry updation
