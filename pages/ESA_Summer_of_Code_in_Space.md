**BRL-CAD was accepted to participate in the 2017 European Space
Agency's Summer of Code in Space!**

# Overview

Starting in 2011, the European Space Agency has run an open source
software development program specifically for *students* called the ESA
Summer of Code in Space (SOCIS). Under this program, ESA funds students
to write *space-related* code for open source projects during the
northern hemisphere's summer timeframe:

-   The student writes a space-related project proposal for BRL-CAD.
    -   Sometimes their project idea caters to something that the open
        source organization suggests and sometimes it's an idea entirely
        of the student's conception.
-   Proposals are reviewed, evaluated, and ranked by the open source
    organization's mentors.
-   ESA allocates a certain number of slots to each participating
    organization
    -   That, in turn, determines how many student developers work with
        that organization.

Students interested in participating with BRL-CAD in SOCIS should review
our **[CHECKLIST](Summer_of_Code/Checklist.md)** to get started.
Start with our [Project
Ideas](ESA_Summer_of_Code_in_Space/Project_Ideas.md) page for a
list of project suggestions that are of particular interest. Students
are welcome to submit their own ideas as well but, more importantly, are
encouraged to collaborate with the developers on formulating projects.

# Getting Selected

SOCIS is about getting people involved in space-related software
development. As such, we heavily weight our application selection
process towards students that are interested in remaining involved in
BRL-CAD and space-related open source software development long after
SOCIS has ended.

***SOCIS is not a job.*** If you think this is just a summer job, then
SOCIS is probably not for you. It's only like a job in terms of planning
your time commitment over the summer.

Additionally, submissions are graded based on perception of the
submitter's abilities to complete the task within the program timeframe,
general consensus on the technical approach being proposed, and overall
interest in having such modifications made to BRL-CAD. Particular notice
is made of students that are responsive to questions and readily
interactive in the IRC channel or on the mailing list. Communication is
a great thing.

Whether or not you are accepted, contributing to open source outside of
SOCIS is the best way to be noticed and get your proposal accepted. Keep
that in mind. Thanks for your interest and we look forward to working
with new BRL-CAD developers!

### Abhijit Nandy

For the 2011 ESA Summer of Code, we selected [Abhijit
Nandy](/wiki/user/Abhijit.md) to work in implementing a non-vacuum
gravity simulator for BRL-CAD. See his user page at
[user/Abhijit](/wiki/user/Abhijit.md) for details on the progress he
made on that project.
