    nodes
-   Incorporated basic animations into visualization for nodes appearing
    and disappearing as well as connections
-   Incorporated adaptive nodes which appear and disappear based on
    presence in network
-   Changed visualization from timeline state-based to data-based with
    data being based on location in timeline to ensure smooth animations
    and non-conflicting adjustments in speed
