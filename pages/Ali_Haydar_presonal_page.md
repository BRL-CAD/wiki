I am currently an undergraduate master student of Civil engineering at
the University of Brescia Italy. I have experience in C++, C,DirectX11.
I have worked with open source CAD programs like SIFEL and FRAME3DD .
and made some projects related to civil engineering like calculating
Beams on elastic foundation (Winkler BOEF) and calculating the water
flow under a dam using finite element method and finite differences
method also I made a program to analyze the results of consolidation
experiment in soil.
