# Overview

Google Code-in is a contest run by Google with a goal of encouraging
young (13 to 17 years old) students to contribute to open source. Since
2010, Google Code-in has been introducing pre-university students from
around the globe to various open source communities.

# Instructions

-   Go to our [Google Code-in](Deuces.md) wiki page, read
    carefully the [CHECKLIST](Google_Code_In/Checklist/2014.md)
    that you need to follow before working for BRL-CAD
-   BRL-CAD will create a list of tasks for students to work upon. Each
    task will have a mentor associated with it.
    -   You can take a look at our [tasks here.](Deuces.md)
-   A student picks a task from the list and he/she is assigned a
    deadline.
    -   While a task is claimed no other student can work on that task.
-   After completion of task it's ready to be reviewed by mentor.
-   Based on the performance of the student mentor may approve,
    disapprove or extend the deadline for the task.

BRL-CAD is one of the 12 selected communities in the year 2014. In
addition to BRL-CAD (a 3D solid modeling system), other participating
organizations include Apertium, Copyleft-Games-group, Drupal, FOSSASIA,
Haiku, KDE, Mifos, OpenMRS, Sahana Software Foundation, Sugar Labs,
Wikimedia Foundation. We have been participating in Google Code In since
