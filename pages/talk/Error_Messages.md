I'm not sure why this page was deleted. I thought it would be really
useful to have a troubleshooter for each of the error messages that can
occur in the mged console. I'll stick this information in a wikibook for
now, until we get a proper reference manual.

Hi Mark and apologies on the lack of communication. The summary message
included details on why the page was removed, but that's apparently not
easy to access once the page is deleted.

The reason was three-fold, one being that the specific statement you
included was more of a notice than an error message. Another one being
that the page was fully lacking in completion and content. There was no
intro explaining the scope or purpose of the page, there were no other
error messages included, it was a mostly useless page. The third was
that the page had substantially no useful content yet was getting linked
into the wiki top-level.

Even if the page were fully expanded, that probably still would have not
been the appropriate place to add the link. I understand that it was
intended as a placeholder, but *particularly* for pages that are going
to get linked into the top-level wiki page, there needs to be more than
just stubbed content. Hope that clears things up some. Thanks for your
interest and efforts to contribute, regardless.
