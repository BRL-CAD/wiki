I have just begun studying MGED-commands. For what my opinion is worth,
permit me to say that I think the DESCRIPTION (= PURPOSE) of a command
should be better placed as the first item, directly after its name.

Maybe it is asking too much also that it be somehow shown if, and
eventually how, the command is (already) implemented in the main menu of
the display and command-windows.

Good idea, except that if there's a connection between MGED commands and
the stuff in the pull-down menus, I've not found it yet. They seem to be
separate things. If I figure out how that works, I'll add it to the
commands. --[Ssd](/wiki/user/Ssd.md) 08:08, 20 November 2009 (EST)
