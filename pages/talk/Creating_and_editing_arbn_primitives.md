## Creation Note

I am working on completing the [BRL-CAD
Primitives](/wiki/doc/BRL-CAD_Primitives) article as an overview of all
such shapes. To keep it to a managable length, I plan on creating a
series of *Creating and editing ... primitives* articles, of which this
is one. It currently contains only the preliminary content that was
formerly in the main article referenced above. Obviously, more work is
needed here. [JoelDBenson](../user/JoelDBenson.md)
