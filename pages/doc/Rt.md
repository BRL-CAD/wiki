The rt command is the primary ray-tracer in BRL-CAD. The rt command can
generate a variety of visualizations for a given BRL-CAD geometry
database model depending on the selected lighting model and options
used. The rt command can be invoked both on the command-line and on the
[mged](mged.md) command-line and is the default ray-tracer
specified in MGED [saveview](saveview.md) scripts and
Tools-&gt;Raytrace renderings.
